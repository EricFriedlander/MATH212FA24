# Part 1: Logistic regression

## Data

The data for this analysis is about credit card customers. It can be found in the file `credit.csv`. The following variables are in the data set:

-   `income`: Income in \$1,000's
-   `limit`: Credit limit
-   `rating`: Credit rating
-   `cards`: Number of credit cards
-   `age`: Age in years
-   `education`: Number of years of education
-   `own`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual owns their home
-   `student`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual was a student
-   `married`: A factor with levels `No` and `Yes` indicating whether the individual was married
-   `region`: A factor with levels `South`, `East`, and `West` indicating the region of the US the individual is from
-   `balance`: Average credit card balance in \$.

**The objective of this analysis is to predict whether a person has maxed out their credit card, i.e., had \$0 average card balance.**

```{r}
#| label: load-claws-data
#| warning: false
#| message: false

credit <- read_csv("data/credit.csv") |>
  mutate(maxed = factor(if_else(balance == 0, 1, 0)))
```

## Exercise 1

-   Why should we use a logistic regression model for this analysis task?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Fill in the blanks. In logistic regression, we

    -   use log-odds to ...

    -   use odds to ...

    -   use probabilities to ...

## Exercise 2

Split the data into 80% training and 20% test sets. Use seed 210.

```{r}
#| label: split-data

set.seed(210)
credit_split <- initial_split(credit, prop = 0.8)
credit_train <- training(credit_split)
credit_test <- testing(credit_split)
```

Specify the logistic regression model. Call it `credit_spec`.

```{r}
#| label: specify-model

#add code here
```

## Exercise 3

Create a recipe called `credit_rec` that does the following:

-   Predict `maxed` using `income`, `age`, and `student`.
-   Mean center the quantitative predictors.
-   Create dummy variables where needed and drop any zero variance variables.

```{r}
#| label: make-recipe

credit_rec <- recipe(maxed ~ income + age + student, 
                     data = credit_train)

# add recipe steps
```

## Exercise 4

Create the workflow that brings together the model specification and recipe. Call it `credit_wflow`.

```{r}
#| label: make-workflow

# add code here
```

## Exercise 5

Conduct 5-fold cross validation. Use seed 210 to create the folds.

```{r}
#| label: cv

# add code here

```

Then, summarize metrics from your CV resamples.

```{r}
#| label: summarize-cv-metrics

# add code here

```

## Exercise 6

Create a workflow for another model with a new recipe that includes the variable `region` along with all the variables and recipe steps from Exercise 3. Conduct cross validation, then select a model between the two.

```{r}
#| label: cv-model2

# add code here

```

## Exercise 7

Fit the model you selected in the previous exercise to the entire training set.

```{r}
#| label: fit-selected-model

# add code here
```

## Exercise 8

Now let's evaluate the performance of the selected model using the testing data.

Create a confusion matrix using a cutoff probability of 0.5.

```{r}
#| label: confusion-matrix

# add code here

```

-   What is the sensitivity? What does it mean in the context of the data ?

-   What is the specificity? What does it mean in the context of the data?

-   What is the true positive rate? What does it mean in the context of the data?

-   What is the false positive rate? What does it mean in the context of the data?

## Exercise 9

Produce the ROC curve.

```{r}
#| label: roc-curve

# add code here

```

-   Describe how you can use this curve to select a cutoff probability (rather than just going with 0.5).

## Exercise 10

Questions about checking conditions for logistic regression:

-   Do we assess conditions on the training or testing set?

-   Why do we not consider categorical predictors when checking linearity?

-   Why do we not need to check constant variance?
