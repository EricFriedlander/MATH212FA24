## Data

Our dataset contains daily rentals from the Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC in 2011 and 2012. It was obtained from the `dcbikeshare` data set in the `dsbox` R package.

We will focus on the following variables in the analysis:

-   `count`: total bike rentals
-   `temp_orig`: Temperature in degrees Celsius
-   `season`: 1 - winter, 2 - spring, 3 - summer, 4 - fall

Click [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/dcbikeshare.html) for the full list of variables and definitions.

```{r load-data}
#| message: false
bikeshare <- read_csv("data/dcbikeshare.csv")
```

## Daily counts and temperature

Let first visualize the distribution of daily bike rentals and temperature as well as the relationship between these two variables.

```{r bike-temp-viz}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

p1 <- gf_histogram(~count, data = bikeshare, binwidth = 250) |>  
  gf_labs(x = "Daily bike rentals")

p2 <- gf_histogram(~temp_orig, data = bikeshare) |> 
  gf_labs(x = "Temperature (Celsius)")

p3 <- gf_point(count ~ temp_orig, data = bikeshare)  |>  
  gf_labs(x = "Temperature (Celsius)", 
       y = "Daily bike rentals")

(p1 | p2) / p3
```

Submit your answers to the following questions to [Poll Everywhere](https://PollEv.com/surveys/2s7kJw1CFyYM3oNOMi3uF/respond).

### Exercise 1

Describe the relationship between daily bike rentals and temperature. Comment on how we expect the number of bike rentals to change as the temperature increases.

### Exercise 2

Suppose you want to fit a model so you can use the temperature to predict the number of bike rentals. Would a model of the form

$$\text{count} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ~ \text{temp\_orig} + \epsilon$$

be an appropriate fit for the data? Why or why not?
