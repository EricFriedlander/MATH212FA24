-   Open [RStudio](https://rstudio.collegeofidaho.edu/) and create a subfolder in your AE folder called "AE-02"

-   Go to the [Canvas](https://cofi.instructure.com/courses/15692/assignments/180578) and locate the `AE-2` assignment. That link should take you directly there.

-   Upload the `ae-02.qmd` and `dcbikeshare.csv` files into the folder you just created.

The .qmd and .html files form this assignment are due in Canvas no later than Tuesday, September 3 at 11:59pm.

## Data

Our data set contains daily rentals from the Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC in 2011 and 2012. It was obtained from the `dcbikeshare` data set in the `dsbox` R package.

We will focus on the following variables in the analysis:

-   `count`: total bike rentals
-   `temp_orig`: Temperature in degrees Celsius
-   `season`: 1 - winter, 2 - spring, 3 - summer, 4 - fall

Click [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/dcbikeshare.html) for the full list of variables and definitions.

Note that you may need to adjust the file path below:

```{r load-data}
#| message: false
bikeshare <- read_csv("data/dcbikeshare.csv")
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Below are visualizations of the distributions of daily bike rentals and temperature as well as the relationship between these two variables.

```{r bike-temp-viz}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

p1 <- gf_histogram(~ count, data = bikeshare, binwidth = 250) |> 
  gf_labs(x = "Daily bike rentals")

p2 <- gf_histogram(~temp_orig, data = bikeshare) |>  
  gf_labs(x = "Temperature (Celsius)")

p3 <- gf_point(count ~ temp_orig, data = bikeshare) |> 
  gf_labs(x = "Temperature (Celsius)", 
       y = "Daily bike rentals")

(p1 | p2) / p3
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
There appears to be one day with a very small number of bike rentals. What was the day? Why were the number of bike rentals so low on that day? *Hint: You can Google the date to figure out what was going on that day.*

### Exercise 2

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
In the raw data, seasons are coded as 1, 2, 3, 4 as numerical values, corresponding to winter, spring, summer, and fall respectively. Recode the `season` variable to make it a categorical variable (a factor) with levels corresponding to season names, making sure that the levels appear in a reasonable order in the variable (i.e., not alphabetical).
:::

```{r recode-season}
# add code developed during livecoding here
```

### Exercise 3

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
We want to evaluate whether the relationship between temperature and daily bike rentals is the same for each season. To answer this question, first create a scatter plot of daily bike rentals vs. temperature faceted by season.
:::

```{r add-chunk-label-2}
# add code developed during livecoding here
```

### Exercise 4

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
-   Which season appears to have the **strongest** relationship between temperature and daily bike rentals? Why do you think the relationship is strongest in this season?

-   Which season appears to have the **weakest** relationship between temperature and daily bike rentals? Why do you think the relationship is weakest in this season?

### Exercise 5 {data-link="Exercise 10"}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
Filter your data for the season with the strongest apparent relationship between temperature and daily bike rentals.
:::

```{r add-chunk-label-3}
# add code developed during livecoding here
```

### Exercise 6

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
Using the subset of the data from [Exercise 5], fit a linear model for predicting daily bike rentals from temperature for this season.
:::

```{r add-chunk-label-4}
# add code developed during livecoding here
```

### Exercise 7

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
Use the output to write out the estimated regression equation.
:::

### Exercise 8

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
Interpret the slope in the context of the data.
:::

\[Add your answer here\]

### Exercise 9

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Interpret the intercept in the context of the data.
:::

\[Add your answer here\]

### Exercise 10

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
Suppose you work for a bike share company in Boise, ID, and they want to predict daily bike rentals in 2024. What is one reason you might recommend they use your analysis for this task? What is one reason you would recommend they [**not**]{.underline} use your analysis for this task?
