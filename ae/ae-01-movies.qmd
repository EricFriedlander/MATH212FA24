We will look at the relationship between budget and revenue for movies made in the United States in 1986 to 2020. The dataset is created based on data from the [Internet Movie Database (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/).

```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)
```

```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
library(DT)
```

## Data

The `movies` data set includes basic information about each movie including budget, genre, movie studio, director, etc. A full list of the variables may be found [here](https://github.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats).

```{r read-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
movies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats/master/movies.csv")
```

View the first 10 rows of data.

```{r}
movies |>
  slice(1:10)
```

## Analysis

We begin by looking at how the average gross revenue (`gross`) has changed over time. Since we want to visualize the results, we will choose a few genres of interest for the analysis.

```{r genre-list}
genre_list <- c("Comedy", "Action", "Animation", "Horror")
```

```{r plot-rating, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
movies |>
  filter(genre %in% genre_list) |> 
  group_by(genre,year) |>
  summarise(avg_gross = mean(gross)) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg_gross, color=genre)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_line() +
    ylab("Average Gross Revenue (in US Dollars)") +
    ggtitle("Gross Revenue Over Time") +
    scale_color_viridis_d()
```

*What do you observe from the plot?*

Next, let's see the relationship between a movie's budget and its gross revenue.

```{r plot-revenue, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
movies |>
  filter(genre %in% genre_list, budget > 0) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=log(budget), y = log(gross), color=genre)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE) + 
  xlab("Log-transformed Budget")+
  ylab("Log-transformed Gross Revenue") +
  facet_wrap(~ genre) + 
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## Exercises

1.  Suppose we fit a regression model for each genre that uses budget to predict gross revenue. What are the signs of the correlation between `budget` and `gross` and the slope in each regression equation?

2.  Suppose we fit the regression model from the previous question. Which genre would you expect to have the smallest residuals, on average (*residual = observed revenue - predicted revenue*)?

3.  In the remaining time, discuss the following: Notice in the graph above that `budget` and `gross` are log-transformed. Why are the log-transformed values of the variables displayed rather than the original values (in U.S. dollars)? **Post your group's response in the AE 01 Movie Budgets comments on Ed Discussion.**
