::: callout-important
-   Open [RStudio](https://rstudio.collegeofidaho.edu/) and create a subfolder in your AE folder called "AE-15".

-   Go to the [Canvas](https://cofi.instructure.com/courses/15692/assignments/183899) and locate your `AE-15` assignment to get started.

-   Upload the `ae-15.qmd` and `tip-data.csv` files into the folder you just created. The `.qmd` and PDF responses are due in Canvas. You can check the due date on the Canvas assignment.

What factors are associated with the amount customers tip at a restaurant? To answer this question, we will use data collected in 2011 by a student at St. Olaf who worked at a local restaurant.[^1]

[^1]: Dahlquist, Samantha, and Jin Dong. 2011. "The Effects of Credit Cards on Tipping." Project for Statistics 212-Statistics for the Sciences, St. Olaf College.

The variables we'll focus on for this analysis are

-   `Tip`: amount of the tip
-   `Meal`: which meal this was (`Lunch`, `Dinner`, `Late Night`)
-   `Party`: number of people in the party
-   `Age`: Age category of person paying the bill (`Yadult`, `Middle`, `SenCit`)

## Analysis goal

The goals of this activity are to comparing models with: - $R^2$ vs.Â $R^2_{Adj}$ - AIC and BIC

## Exercise 1

Fit two models:

1.  `tip_fit_1`: predict `Tip` from `Party`, `Age`, and `Meal`
2.  `tip_fit_2`: predict `Tip` from `Party`, `Age`, `Meal`, and `Day`.

## Exercise 2

Apply `glance` to both models above to find the $R^2$ and $R^2_{adj}$ values?

## Exercise 3

1.  Which model would we choose based on $R^2$?
2.  Which model would we choose based on Adjusted $R^2$?
3.  Which statistic should we use to choose the final model - $R^2$ or Adjusted $R^2$? Why?

## Exercise 4

Reference the output from Exercise 2.

1.  Which model would we choose based on AIC?

2.  Which model would we choose based on BIC?

## Exercise 5 (Time Permitting)

Find the best model you can! You have until the end of class! Team with the best model gets a seriously great high-five.
