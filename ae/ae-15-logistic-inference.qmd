## Response to Leukemia treatment

Today's data is from a study where 51 untreated adult patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia who were given a course of treatment, and they were assessed as to their response to the treatment.[^1]

[^1]: The data set is from the Stat2Data R package. This AE is adapted from exercises in *Stat 2.*

The goal of today's analysis is to use pre-treatment factors to predict how likely it is a patient will respond to the treatment.

We will use the following variables:

-   `Age`: Age at diagnosis (in years)
-   `Smear`: Differential percentage of blasts
-   `Infil`: Percentage of absolute marrow leukemia infiltrate
-   `Index`: Percentage labeling index of the bone marrow leukemia cells
-   `Blasts`: Absolute number of blasts, in thousands
-   `Temp`: Highest temperature of the patient prior to treatment, in degrees Fahrenheit
-   `Resp`: 1 = responded to treatment or 0 = failed to respond

```{r, message = F}
leukemia <- read_csv("data/leukemia.csv") |>
  mutate(Resp = factor(Resp))
```

## Estimating coefficients for logistic regression

### Illustrating maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

Suppose we want to use the data to understand the probability a randomly selected adult diagnosed with leukemia will respond to the treatment.

Here are the results from our data:

```{r}
leukemia %>%
  count(Resp) %>%
  mutate(prob = n /sum(n))
```

Let's set up some notation:

-   $Y$: Bernoulli random variable indicating whether an adult diagnosed with leukemia responds to the treatment
-   $y$: outcome for an individual adult (1: responded to treatment or 0: failed to respond)
-   $p$: probability a randomly selected adult diagnosed with leukemia responds to the treatment

Our goal is to find the most likely value of $p$ given our data.

The likelihood function of the outcome for a single randomly selected adult diagnosed with leukemia is $$P(Y = y) = p^y(1-p)^{1-y}$$

The likelihood function, i.e. the joint probability, for the outcomes of 51 adults is

$$L = P(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{51}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{51} p^{y_i} (1 - p)^{1 - y_i}$$

We often use the log of the likelihood function, so we can work with sums rather than products.

$$\begin{aligned}\log L = \log[P(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{51})] &= \log\Big[\prod_{i = 1}^{51} p^{y_i} (1 - p)^{1 - y_i}\Big] \\ 
&= \sum_{i=1}^{51} y_i \log(p) + (1 - y_i)\log(1 - p)\end{aligned}$$

We can rewrite the equation and plug in the results from our data:

$$\begin{aligned} \log L &= \sum_{i=1}^{51} y_i \log(p) + (1 - y_i)\log(1 - p) \\ 
& = \log(p)\sum_{i=1}^{51}y_i + \log(1 - p)\sum_{i=1}^{51}(1 - y_{i}) \\
& = \log(p)\times 24 + \log(1 - p)\times 27 \end{aligned}$$

Let's plug in different values of $p$ and find the value that maximizes this equation.

```{r}
p <- seq(0.01,.99,0.005)
logL <- log(p)*24+ log(1-p)*27 #log likelihood
L <- exp(logL) #likelihood
results <- tibble(p, logL, L)

#identify the the mle
results <- results %>%
  mutate(mle = if_else(logL == max(results$logL), "1", "0"))
```

```{r}
# plot log likelihood
ggplot(data = results, aes(x = p, y = logL)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = mle)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,.1)) + 
  labs(title = "Maximizing Log Liklehood") 
```

```{r}
#plot likelihood
ggplot(data = results, aes(x = p, y = L)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = mle)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,.1)) + 
  labs(title = "Maximizing Likelihood") 

```

The MLE, the value that maximizes the (log) likelihood function is

```{r}
results %>%
  filter(mle == 1)
```

As we might expect, this is the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ from our data.

### Extending to logistic regression

The parameters for logistic regression are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. Suppose we have the model

$$\log\big(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$

The estimates $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ are the ones maximize the log likelihood function

$$L = P(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} \pi^{y_i}(1-\pi)^{1-y_i}$$

where $$\pi = \frac{\exp\{\beta_0 + \beta_1x\}}{1 + \exp\{\beta_0 + \beta_1x\}}$$

There isn't a closed-form solution for the log-likelihood, so numerical methods such as Iterative Weighted Least Squares are used to estimate the coefficients. This is the method used to estimate the coefficients in R.

Let's fit a model using `Age` as a predictor and see some details of coefficient estimation.[^2] This is for demonstration purposes.

[^2]: Trace function for current version of R from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33320973/is-there-a-way-to-obtain-coefficients-for-each-step-of-the-optimization-algorith).

```{r}
# Function that allows us to see the coefficients at each iteration
trace(glm.fit, quote(cat <- function(...) {
  base::cat(...)
  if (...length() >= 3 && identical(..3, " Iterations - ")) print(coefold)
}))


# Fit model to see details
resp_fit_details <- glm(Resp ~ Age, data = leukemia, 
                        family = "binomial", 
                        control = glm.control(trace = TRUE))

```

## Inference for coefficients

1.  Fit a model using `Temp` , `Age`, and `Index` to predict whether or not a patient responded to the treatment. Display the model and the 95% confidence interval for the model coefficients.

```{r}

```

2.  Interpret the coefficient of `Temp` in the context of the data in terms of the odds an individual responds to the treatment.

3.  Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the coefficient of `Temp` in terms of the odds an individual responds to the treatment.

4.  What is the distribution of the test statistic associated with `Temp`?

5.  Is `Temp` a useful predictor of the likelihood an individual responds to the treatment? Briefly explain.
