## Data

The data set for this assignment is a subset from the [Spotify Songs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md) Tidy Tuesday data set. The data were originally obtained from Spotify using the **spotifyr** R package.

It contains numerous characteristics for each song. You can see the full list of variables and definitions [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md). This analysis will focus specifically on the following variables:

| energy           | double    | Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. |
| valence          | double    | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).                                                                                                                                         |

Are high energy songs more positive? To answer this question, we'll analyze data on some of the most popular songs on Spotify, i.e. those with `track_popularity >= 80`. We'll use linear regression to fit a model to predict a song's positiveness (`valence`) based on its energy level (`energy`).

Below are plots as part of the exploratory data analysis.

```{r}
#| label: univariate-eda
p1 <- ggplot(data = spotify, aes(x = valence)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Valence", 
       subtitle = " for Popular songs on Spotify", 
       x = "Valence")

p2 <- ggplot(data = spotify, aes(x = energy)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Energy", 
       subtitle = "for Popular songs on Spotify", 
       x = "Energy")
p1 + p2
```

```{r}
#| label: bivariate-eda
ggplot(data = spotify, aes(x = energy, y = valence)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Valence vs. Energy", 
       subtitle = "Popular songs on Spotify", 
       x = "Energy", 
       y = "Valence")
```

## Exercise 1

Fit a model using the `energy` of a song to predict its `valence`, i.e. positiveness. Include the 90% confidence interval for the coefficients, and display the output using 3 digits.

```{r fit-model}
## add code
```

## Exercise 2

Let's check the model conditions before doing any inference. Fill in the code below to use the `augment()` function to create a new data frame containing the residuals and fitted values (among other information)

::: callout-important
Note: Remove `#|eval: false` from the code chunk after you have filled in the code.
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
spotify_aug <- augment(_____)
```

## Exercise 3

Make a plot of the residual vs. fitted values.

```{r}
#| label: resid-vs-fitted

# add code here
```

## Exercise 4

Fill in the code to make a histogram of the residuals and a normal QQ-plot.

```{r}
#| label: resid-dist
#| eval: false

resid_hist <- ggplot(data = ____, aes(x = ____)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "_____", 
       y = "_____", 
       title = "____")

resid_qq <- ggplot(data = ____, aes(sample = ____)) + 
  stat_qq() + 
 ____() + 
  labs(x = "_____", 
       y = "_____", 
       title = "____")

resid_hist + resid_qq
```

## Exercise 5

Assess the four model conditions. Use the plots from the previous exercises to help make the assessment.

-   Linearity
-   Constant variance
-   Normality
-   Independence

## Exercise 6

Calculate $R^2$ and interpret this value in the context of the data.

```{r}
#| label: calc-rsq
```

## Exercise 7

Calculate RMSE and interpret this value in the context of the data.

```{r}
#| label: calc-rmse
```
