## Reminders {.midi}

Make sure to do the following as you complete the assignment:

-   Write all narrative in complete sentences.

-   Use informative axis titles and labels on all graphs.

-   Implement version control in your reproducible workflow.

    -   Throughout the assignment periodically **render** your Quarto document to produce the updated PDF, **commit** the changes in the Git pane, and **push** the updated files to GitHub.

    -   Benchmark: Push changes to GitHub at least three times as you work on the assignment.

## Today's lab

-   Focused on mathematical inference for simple linear regression and checking model conditions.

    -   We will talk about model conditions in the September 20 lecture.

-   Remember to mark all pages in your Gradescope submission. The first page should be marked for the "Workflow & formatting" section.

-   Use lectures and application exercises as reference as you complete the lab.\
