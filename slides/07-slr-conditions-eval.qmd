# Model conditions

## Model conditions

1.  **Linearity:** There is a linear relationship between the outcome and predictor variables
2.  **Constant variance:** The variability of the errors is equal for all values of the predictor variable
3.  **Normality:** The errors follow a normal distribution
4.  **Independence:** The errors are independent from each other

## Linearity 

-   If the linear model, $\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i$ adequately describes the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, then the residuals should reflect random (chance) error

-   To assess this, we can look at a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values

-   **Linearity satisfied** if there is no distinguishable pattern in the residuals plot, i.e. the residuals should be randomly scattered

-   A non-random pattern (e.g. a parabola) suggests a linear model does not adequately describe the relationship between $X$ and $Y$

## Linearity

✅ The residuals vs. fitted values plot should show a random scatter of residuals (no distinguishable pattern or structure)

## Constant variance

-   If the spread of the distribution of $Y$ is equal for all values of $X$then the spread of the residuals should be approximately equal for each value of $X$

-   To assess this, we can look at a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values

-   **Constant variance satisfied** if the vertical spread of the residuals is approximately equal as you move from left to right (i.e. there is no "fan" pattern)

-   A fan pattern suggests the constant variance assumption is not satisfied and transformation or some other remedy is required (more on this later in the semester)

## Constant variance

✅ The vertical spread of the residuals should be relatively constant across the plot

```{r}
#| ref.label: "res-vs-fit"
#| echo: false
```

## Non-constant variance

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| out.width: "100%"
#| echo: false
ggplot(df, aes(x = x_fan, y = y_fan)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#8F2D56") +
  labs(
    x = "X", y = "Y",
    title = "Observed data + model"
    )

fan_aug <- augment(fan_fit$fit)

ggplot(fan_aug, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +

  labs(
    x = "Fitted value", y = "Residual",
    title = "Residuals vs. fitted values"
  ) +
  ylim(-15, 15)
```

## Normality 

-   The linear model assumes that the distribution of $Y$ is Normal for every value of $X$

-   This is impossible to check in practice, so we will look at the overall distribution of the residuals to assess if the normality assumption is satisified

-   **Normaltiy satisified** if a histogram of the residuals is approximately normal

    -   Can also check that a normal QQ-plot falls along a diagonal line

-   Most inferential methods for regression are robust to some departures from normality, so we can proceed with inference if the sample size is sufficiently large, $n > 30$

## Normality 

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(df_aug, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50000, color = "white") +
  labs(
    x = "Residual",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Histogram of residuals"
  )
```

## Check normality using a QQ-plot

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(df_aug, aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50000, color = "white")  +
  labs(
    x = "Residual",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Histogram of residuals"
  )
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(df_aug, aes(sample = .resid)) +
  stat_qq()+
  stat_qq_line() + 
  labs(x = "Theoretical quantile", 
       y = "Observed quantile", 
       title = "Normal QQ-plot of residuals")
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Assess whether residuals lie along the diagonal line of the Quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot).

-   If so, the residuals are normally distributed.
:::
:::

## Normality 

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(df_aug, aes(sample = .resid)) +
  stat_qq()+
  stat_qq_line() + 
  labs(x = "Theoretical quantile", 
       y = "Observed quantile", 
       title = "Normal QQ-plot of residuals")
```

❌ The residuals do not appear to follow a normal distribution, because the points do not lie on the diagonal line, so normality is not satisfied.

✅ The sample size $n = 98 > 30$, so the sample size is large enough to relax this condition and proceed with inference.

## Independence

-   We can often check the independence assumption based on the context of the data and how the observations were collected

-   Two common violations of the independence assumption:

    -   **Serial Effect**: If the data were collected over time, plot the residuals in time order to see if there is a pattern (serial correlation)

    -   **Cluster Effect**: If there are subgroups represented in the data that are not accounted for in the model (e.g., type of house), you can color the points in the residual plots by group to see if the model systematically over or under predicts for a particular subgroup

. . .

✅ If this is a random sample of Duke Forest Houses, the error for one house does not tell us anything about the error for another house.

## Comparing inferential methods

::: question
-   What are the advantages of using simulation-based inference methods? What are the advantages of using inference methods based on mathematical models?

-   Under what scenario(s) would you prefer to use simulation-based methods? Under what scenario(s) would you prefer to use methods based on mathematical models?
