# Mathematical models for inference

## Topics

-   Define mathematical models to conduct inference for the slope

-   Use mathematical models to

    -   calculate confidence interval for the slope

    -   conduct a hypothesis test for the slope

## Computational setup

```{r packages}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

# load packages
library(tidyverse)   # for data wrangling and visualization
library(broom)       # for formatting model output
library(scales)      # for pretty axis labels
library(knitr)       # for pretty tables
library(kableExtra)  # also for pretty tables
library(patchwork)   # arrange plots

# HEB Dataset
heb <- read_csv("data/HEBIncome.csv") |> 
  mutate(Avg_Income_K = Avg_Household_Income/1000)

# set default theme and larger font size for ggplot2
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 20))
```

## The regression model, revisited

```{r}
#| echo: true
heb_fit <- lm(Number_Organic ~ Avg_Income_K, data = heb)

tidy(heb_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2)
```

## Inference, revisited {.midi}

::: incremental
-   Earlier we computed a confidence interval and conducted a hypothesis test via simulation:
    -   CI: Bootstrap the observed sample to simulate the distribution of the slope
    -   HT: Permute the observed sample to simulate the distribution of the slope under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true
-   Now we'll do these based on theoretical results, i.e., by using the Central Limit Theorem to define the distribution of the slope and use features (shape, center, spread) of this distribution to compute bounds of the confidence interval and the p-value for the hypothesis test
:::

## Mathematical representation of the model {.midi}

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &= Model + Error \\
&= f(X) + \epsilon \\
&= \mu_{Y|X} + \epsilon \\
&= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

where the errors are independent and normally distributed:

. . .

-   **independent**: Knowing the error term for one observation doesn't tell you anything about the error term for another observation
-   **normally distributed**: $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

## Mathematical representation, visualized {.midi}

$$
Y|X \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X, \sigma_\epsilon^2)
$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![Image source: *Introduction to the Practice of Statistics (5th ed)*](images/06/regression.png)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Mean: $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X$, the predicted value based on the regression model
-   Variance: $\sigma_\epsilon^2$, constant across the range of $X$
    -   How do we estimate $\sigma_\epsilon^2$?
:::
:::

## Regression standard error

Once we fit the model, we can use the residuals to estimate the **regression standard error**, the average distance between the observed values and the regression line

$$
\hat{\sigma}_\epsilon = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_\limits{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n-2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_\limits{i=1}^ne_i^2}{n-2}}
$$

. . .

::: question
1.  Why divide by $n - 2$?

2.  Why do we care about the value of the regression standard error?
:::

## Standard error of $\hat{\beta}_1$

The **standard error of** $\hat{\beta}_1$ quantifies the sampling variability in the estimated slopes

$$
SE_{\hat{\beta}_1} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{1}{(n-1)s_X^2}}
$$

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(heb_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

# Mathematical models for inference for $\beta_1$

## Hypothesis test for the slope {.midi}

**Hypotheses:** $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ vs. $H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0$

. . .

**Test statistic:** Number of standard errors the estimate is away from the null

$$
T = \frac{\text{Estimate - Null Value}}{\text{Standard error}} \\
$$

. . .

**p-value:** Probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme (in the direction of the alternative hypothesis) from the null value as the one observed

$$
\text{p-value} = P(|t| > |\text{test statistic}|),
$$

calculated from a $t$ distribution with $n - 2$ degrees of freedom

## Hypothesis test: Test statistic

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(heb_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

$$
T = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - 0}{SE_{\hat{\beta}_1}} = \frac{0.96 - 0}{0.13} = 7.38
$$

::: question
How should we interpret this test statistic?
:::

## Hypothesis test: p-value

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(heb_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(openintro)
normTail(L = -7.38, U = 7.38, df = nrow(heb) - 2, xlim = c(-9,9), col = "#D9E3E4")
```

## Hypothesis test: p-value

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(heb_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

**A more exact p-value**

```{r}
2 * pt(q = 7.38, df = 35, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

::: question
Interpret this p-value.
:::

## Understanding the p-value

| Magnitude of p-value    | Interpretation                        |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| p-value \< 0.01         | strong evidence against $H_0$         |
| 0.01 \< p-value \< 0.05 | moderate evidence against $H_0$       |
| 0.05 \< p-value \< 0.1  | weak evidence against $H_0$           |
| p-value \> 0.1          | effectively no evidence against $H_0$ |

::: callout-important
These are general guidelines. The strength of evidence depends on the context of the problem.
:::

## [Hypothesis test: Conclusion, in context]{.r-fit-text}

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(heb_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

-   The data provide convincing evidence that the population slope $\beta_1$ is different from 0.
-   The data provide convincing evidence of a linear relationship between average household income and the number of organic vegetable options available.

## Confidence interval for the slope

$$
\text{Estimate} \pm \text{ (critical value) } \times \text{SE}
$$

. . .

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 \pm t^* \times SE_{\hat{\beta}_1}
$$

where $t^*$ is calculated from a $t$ distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom

# Intervals for predictions

## Intervals for predictions {.smaller} 

-   Question: *"What is the predicted number of organic vegetable options in a neighborhood with an average income of \$70k?"*
-   We said reporting a single estimate for the slope is not wise, and we should report a plausible range instead
-   Similarly, reporting a single prediction for a new value is not wise, and we should report a plausible range instead

```{r}

## Two types of predictions

1.  Prediction for the mean: "What is the average predicted number of organic vegetable options in a neighborhood with an average income of \$70k?"

2.  Prediction for an individual observation: "What is the predicted number of organic vegetable options at a single HEB in a neighborhood with an average income of \$70k?"

. . .

::: question
Which would you expect to be more variable? The average prediction or the prediction for an individual observation? Based on your answer, how would you expect the widths of plausible ranges for these two predictions to compare?
:::

## Uncertainty in predictions

**Confidence interval for the mean outcome:** $$\large{\hat{y} \pm t_{n-2}^* \times \color{purple}{\mathbf{SE}_{\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}}}$$

. . .

**Prediction interval for an individual observation:** $$\large{\hat{y} \pm t_{n-2}^* \times \color{purple}{\mathbf{SE_{\hat{y}}}}}$$

## Standard errors

**Standard error of the mean outcome:** $$SE_{\hat{\mu}} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$

. . .

**Standard error of an individual outcome:** $$SE_{\hat{y}} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$

## Standard errors

**Standard error of the mean outcome:** $$SE_{\hat{\mu}} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$

**Standard error of an individual outcome:** $$SE_{\hat{y}} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{\mathbf{\color{purple}{\Large{1}}} + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$

## Confidence interval

The 95% **confidence interval** for the *mean* outcome:

```{r}
#| echo: true
new_neighborhood <- tibble(Avg_Income_K = 70)

predict(heb_fit, newdata = new_neighborhood, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95) |>
  kable()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
new_neighborhood_ci <- as.tibble(predict(heb_fit, newdata = new_neighborhood, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95) )
```

. . .

* We are 95% confident that the *mean* number of organic vegetable options offered by HEB in a neighborhood with an average income of \$70k is between `r new_neighborhood_ci$lwr |> round(digits=2)` and `r new_neighborhood_ci$upr |>  round(digits=2)`.

## Prediction interval

The 95% **prediction interval** for an *individual* outcome:

```{r}
#| echo: true
predict(heb_fit, newdata = new_neighborhood, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95) |>
  kable()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
new_neighborhood_pi <- as.tibble(predict(heb_fit, newdata = new_neighborhood, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95))
```

. . .

We are 95% confident that the number of organic vegetable options offered by HEB in a neighborhood with an average income of \$70k is between `r new_neighborhood_pi$lwr |> round(digits=2)` and `r new_neighborhood_pi$upr |>  round(digits=2)`.
