## Regina Nuzzo {.midi}

From ["Tips for Communicating Statistical Significance."](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/science-health-public-trust/perspectives/science-health-public-trust/tips-communicating-statistical-significance)

*"That we use p-values to alert us to surprising data results, not to give a final answer on anything. (Or at least that's what we should be doing). And that results can get flagged as "statistically surprising" with a small p-value for a number of reasons"*

1.  *There was a fluke.*

2.  *Something was violated.*

3.  *There was a real but tiny relationship.*

4.  *There was a relationship that is worth more study.*

*Or any combination of the above.*

# Mathematical models for inference

## Topics

-   Define mathematical models to conduct inference for the slope

-   Use mathematical models to

    -   calculate confidence interval for the slope

    -   conduct a hypothesis test for the slope

## Computational setup

```{r packages}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

# load packages
library(tidyverse)   # for data wrangling and visualization
library(tidymodels)  # for modeling
library(openintro)   # for the duke_forest dataset
library(scales)      # for pretty axis labels
library(knitr)       # for pretty tables
library(kableExtra)  # also for pretty tables
library(patchwork)   # arrange plots

# set default theme and larger font size for ggplot2
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 20))
```

## The regression model, revisited

```{r}
#| echo: true
df_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm") |>
  fit(price ~ area, data = duke_forest)

tidy(df_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 3)
```

## Inference, revisited {.midi}

::: incremental
-   Earlier we computed a confidence interval and conducted a hypothesis test via simulation:
    -   CI: Bootstrap the observed sample to simulate the distribution of the slope
    -   HT: Permute the observed sample to simulate the distribution of the slope under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true
-   Now we'll do these based on theoretical results, i.e., by using the Central Limit Theorem to define the distribution of the slope and use features (shape, center, spread) of this distribution to compute bounds of the confidence interval and the p-value for the hypothesis test
:::

## Mathematical representation of the model {.midi}

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &= Model + Error \\
&= f(X) + \epsilon \\
&= \mu_{Y|X} + \epsilon \\
&= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

where the errors are independent and normally distributed:

. . .

-   **independent**: Knowing the error term for one observation doesn't tell you anything about the error term for another observation
-   **normally distributed**: $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$

## Mathematical representation, visualized {.midi}

$$
Y|X \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X, \sigma_\epsilon^2)
$$

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![Image source: *Introduction to the Practice of Statistics (5th ed)*](images/06/regression.png)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Mean: $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X$, the predicted value based on the regression model
-   Variance: $\sigma_\epsilon^2$, constant across the range of $X$
    -   How do we estimate $\sigma_\epsilon^2$?
:::
:::

## Regression standard error

Once we fit the model, we can use the residuals to estimate the **regression standard error**, the average distance between the observed values and the regression line

$$
\hat{\sigma}_\epsilon = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_\limits{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n-2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_\limits{i=1}^ne_i^2}{n-2}}
$$

. . .

::: question
1.  Why divide by $n - 2$?

2.  Why do we care about the value of the regression standard error?
:::

## Standard error of $\hat{\beta}_1$

The **standard error of** $\hat{\beta}_1$ quantifies the sampling variability in the estimated slopes

$$
SE_{\hat{\beta}_1} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{1}{(n-1)s_X^2}}
$$

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(df_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

# Mathematical models for inference for $\beta_1$

## Hypothesis test for the slope {.midi}

**Hypotheses:** $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ vs. $H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0$

. . .

**Test statistic:** Number of standard errors the estimate is away from the null

$$
T = \frac{\text{Estimate - Null}}{\text{Standard error}} \\
$$

. . .

**p-value:** Probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme (in the direction of the alternative hypothesis) from the null value as the one observed

$$
p-value = P(|t| > |\text{test statistic}|),
$$

calculated from a $t$ distribution with $n - 2$ degrees of freedom

## Hypothesis test: Test statistic

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(df_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

$$
T = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - 0}{SE_{\hat{\beta}_1}} = \frac{159.48 - 0}{18.17} = 8.78
$$

## Understanding the p-value

| Magnitude of p-value    | Interpretation                        |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| p-value \< 0.01         | strong evidence against $H_0$         |
| 0.01 \< p-value \< 0.05 | moderate evidence against $H_0$       |
| 0.05 \< p-value \< 0.1  | weak evidence against $H_0$           |
| p-value \> 0.1          | effectively no evidence against $H_0$ |

::: callout-important
These are general guidelines. The strength of evidence depends on the context of the problem.
:::

## Hypothesis test: Conclusion, in context

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(df_fit) |>
  kable(digits = 2) |>
  row_spec(2, background = "#D9E3E4")
```

-   The data provide convincing evidence that the population slope $\beta_1$ is different from 0.
-   The data provide convincing evidence of a linear relationship between area and price of houses in Duke Forest.

## Confidence interval for the slope

$$
\text{Estimate} \pm \text{ (critical value) } \times \text{SE}
$$

. . .

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 \pm t^* \times SE_{\hat{\beta}_1}
$$

where $t^*$ is calculated from a $t$ distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom

# Intervals for predictions

## Intervals for predictions {.midi}

-   Suppose we want to answer the question *"What is the predicted sale price of a Duke Forest house that is 2,800 square feet?"*
-   We said reporting a single estimate for the slope is not wise, and we should report a plausible range instead
-   Similarly, reporting a single prediction for a new value is not wise, and we should report a plausible range instead

```{r}
#| fig.width: 10
#| echo: false

x_new <- 2800
y_hat_x_new <- predict(df_fit, new_data = tibble(area = x_new)) |> pull()

ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +

## Two types of predictions

1.  Prediction for the mean: "What is the average predicted sale price of Duke Forest houses that are 2,800 square feet?"

2.  Prediction for an individual observation: "What is the predicted sale price of a Duke Forest house that is 2,800 square feet?"

. . .

::: question
Which would you expect to be more variable? The average prediction or the prediction for an individual observation? Based on your answer, how would you expect the widths of plausible ranges for these two predictions to compare?
:::

## Uncertainty in predictions

**Confidence interval for the mean outcome:** $$\large{\hat{y} \pm t_{n-2}^* \times \color{purple}{\mathbf{SE}_{\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}}}}$$

. . .

**Prediction interval for an individual observation:** $$\large{\hat{y} \pm t_{n-2}^* \times \color{purple}{\mathbf{SE_{\hat{y}}}}}$$

## Standard errors

**Standard error of the mean outcome:** $$SE_{\hat{\mu}} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$

. . .

**Standard error of an individual outcome:** $$SE_{\hat{y}} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$

## Standard errors

**Standard error of the mean outcome:** $$SE_{\hat{\mu}} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$

**Standard error of an individual outcome:** $$SE_{\hat{y}} = \hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{\mathbf{\color{purple}{\Large{1}}} + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$

## Confidence interval

The 95% **confidence interval** for the *mean* outcome:

```{r}
#| echo: true
new_house <- tibble(area = 2800)

predict(df_fit, new_data = new_house, type = "conf_int", level = 0.95) |>
  kable()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
new_house_ci <- predict(df_fit, new_data = new_house, type = "conf_int", level = 0.95)
```

. . .

We are 95% confident that mean sale price of Duke Forest houses that are 2,800 square feet is between `r dollar(new_house_ci$.pred_lower)` and `r dollar(new_house_ci$.pred_upper)`.

## Prediction interval

The 95% **prediction interval** for an *individual* outcome:

```{r}
#| echo: true
predict(df_fit, new_data = new_house, type = "pred_int", level = 0.95) |>
  kable()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
new_house_pi <- predict(df_fit, new_data = new_house, type = "pred_int", level = 0.95)
```

. . .

We are 95% confident that predicted sale price of a Duke Forest house that is 2,800 square feet is between `r dollar(new_house_pi$.pred_lower)` and `r dollar(new_house_pi$.pred_upper)`.

## Comparing intervals

## Extrapolation

Using the model to predict for values outside the range of the original data is **extrapolation**.
