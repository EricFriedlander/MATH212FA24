## Statistician of the Day

-   what this is

-   goal

-   How the statisticians are chosen

-   You'll get a chance to contribute

## Statistician of the day

## Meet your neighbor

Take a few moments to meet or (reconnect with) your neighbor!

-   Name
-   Year
-   Major
-   A highlight or something that stood out in the first two days of class

# Reproducibility

## Reproducibility checklist

::: question
What does it mean for an analysis to be reproducible?
:::

. . .

**Near term goals**:

‚úîÔ∏è Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?

‚úîÔ∏è Does the code actually do what you think it does?

‚úîÔ∏è In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

. . .

**Long term goals**:

‚úîÔ∏è Can the code be used for other data?

‚úîÔ∏è Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Why is reproducibility important?

## When things go wrong

\[ Get examples from Timbers paper\]

## Toolkit

-   **Scriptability** $\rightarrow$ R

-   **Literate programming** (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ Quarto

-   **Version control** $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

    -   *More on this in this week's lab*

## What are R and RStudio?

-   R is a statistical programming language

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

## RStudio IDE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quarto

-   Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render

-   Code goes in chunks and narrative goes outside of chunks

-   Visual editor to make document editing experience similar to a word processor (Google docs, Word, Pages, etc.)

## Quarto

![](images/03/quarto.png){fig-align="center"}

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every application exercise and assignment is written in a Quarto document

-   You'll have a template Quarto document to start with

-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester

## Application exercise - maybe update this?

\[Can't use R in class bc Thursday lab hasn't gone yet\]

# Multivariable relationships

-   Take the Fall 2021 Starbucks notes + update. Maybe use Ikea data?
