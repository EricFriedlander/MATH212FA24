# Reproducibility

## Reproducibility checklist

::: question
What does it mean for an analysis to be reproducible?
:::

. . .

**Near term goals**:

‚úîÔ∏è Can the tables and figures be exactly reproduced from the code and data?

‚úîÔ∏è Does the code actually do what you think it does?

‚úîÔ∏è In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

. . .

**Long term goals**:

‚úîÔ∏è Can the code be used for other data?

‚úîÔ∏è Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Why is reproducibility important?

-   Results produced are more reliable and trustworthy [@ostblom2022]

-   Facilitates more effective collaboration [@ostblom2022]

-   Contributing to science, which builds and organizes knowledge in terms of testable hypotheses [@alexander2023]

-   Possible to identify and correct errors or biases in the analysis process [@alexander2023]

## Toolkit

-   **Scriptability** $\rightarrow$ R

-   **Literate programming** (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ Quarto

-   **Version control** $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub (Beyond the scope of this course)


## R and RStudio

-   R is a statistical programming language

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RStudio IDE

![](images/02/rstudio-panes.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quarto

-   Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render

-   Code goes in chunks and narrative goes outside of chunks

-   Visual editor to make document editing experience similar to a word processor (Google docs, Word, Pages, etc.)

## Quarto

![](images/03/quarto.png){fig-align="center"}

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every application exercise and assignment is written in a Quarto document

-   You'll have a template Quarto document to start with

-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester




## Rest of class {.midi}

- Work on HW 0!
