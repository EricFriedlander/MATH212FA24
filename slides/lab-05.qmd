# Welcome

## Team workflow

-   Only <u>**one**</u> team member should type at a time. There are no markers in today's lab, but you should use a similar workflow as Lab 04.

    -   Every team member should still be engaged in discussion for all questions, even if it's not your turn type.

-   Don't forget to **pull** to get your teammates' updates before making changes to the `.qmd` file.

    ::: callout-important
    **Only one submission per team on Gradescope. Carefully read the submission instructions at the end of the lab instructions.**

## Tips for working on a team {.midi}

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

-   The labs are structured to help you learn the steps of a data analysis. Do not split up the lab among the team members; work on it together in its entirety.

-   Everyone has something to contribute! Use the lab groups as an opportunity to share ideas and learn from each other.
