# Regression analysis

## What is regression analysis?

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}
> "In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when ***the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')***. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed."

## Course FAQ

**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**

A - Introductory statistics or probability course at Duke

. . .

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**

A - Yes. We will use the computing language R for analysis, Quarto for writing up results, and GitHub for version control and collaboration

. . .

**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory of regression?**

A - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of simple linear regression. There a 0.5-credit course [STA 211: Mathematics of Regression](https://stat.duke.edu/courses/mathematics-regression) to take simultaneously or after this course to dive into more of the mathematics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Course learning objectives

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.

-   use R to fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.

-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.

-   use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

-   effectively communicate statistical results through writing and oral presentations.
