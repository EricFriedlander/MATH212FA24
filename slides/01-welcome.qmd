# Statistical modeling

## What is a model?

:::{.incremental}
- DATA = MODEL + ERROR
- DATA = PATTERN + DEPARTURES FROM PATTERN
  - How do we identify the actual pattern?
- **GOAL:** Find a model for a relationship between a **response/outcome/target variable** $Y$ and one (or more) **explanatory/predictor variables** ($X_1,\ldots,X_k$)
- Models are a simplified but tractable version of reality
:::


:::{.question}
What are *response* and *explanatory* variables?
:::

## Geoge E. P. Box

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
- From wikipedia: British statistician, who worked in the areas of quality control, time-series analysis, design of experiments, and Bayesian inference. He has been called "one of the great statistical minds of the 20th century".
- "all models are wrong, but some are useful"

## Why build a model?

1. Making predictions
2. Understanding relationships
3. Assessing differences

## What is regression analysis?

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}
> "In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when ***the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')***. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed."

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) (previous definition)
:::

Note:  I don't really like the terms "independent" and "dependent" variables

## Course FAQ {.midi}

**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**

A - Introductory statistics or previous experience with mathematics at a level that would allow you to learn intro stats concepts relatively easily

. . .

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**

A - Yes. We will use the computing language R for analysis and Quarto for writing up results.

. . .

**Q - Am I expected to have experience using any of these tools?**

A - No. I do not expect you to have any exposure to R and certainly not Quarto.

. . .

**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory of regression?**

A - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of simple linear regression.

## Course learning objectives {.midi}

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.

-   use R to fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.

-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.

-   use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

-   effectively communicate statistical results through writing and oral presentations.

# Course policies

## Late Homework

-   There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late for the first two days. After 2 days, students will receive a 30% reduction. No homework will be accepted after it is returned to the class

## Late Application Exercises

-   AEs are due three days after the class they are assigned. No late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed as in-class activities to help you prepare for homework. 

## Late Exams and Final Project

-   If an application exercise, exam, or final project must be missed due to a school-sponsored event, you must let me know at least a week ahead of time so that we can schedule a time for you to make up the work before you leave. If you must miss a exam or the final project due to illness, you must let me know before class that day so that we can schedule a time for you to take a make-up quiz or exam. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in a 35% penalty the corresponding assignment.  

## Academic integrity {.smaller}

> The College of Idaho maintains that academic honesty and integrity are essential values in the educational process. Operating under an Honor Code philosophy, the College expects conduct rooted in honesty, integrity, and understanding, allowing members of a diverse student body to live together and interact and learn from one another in ways that protect both personal freedom and community standards. Violations of academic honesty are addressed primarily by the instructor and may be referred to the [Student Judicial Board](https://collegeofidaho.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Policies-and-Procedures/Academic-Misconduct).

By participating in this course, you are agreeing that all your work and conduct will be in accordance with the College of Idaho Honor Code.

## Collaboration & sharing code

-   I have policies! 

-   Let's read about them in the [Academic honesty](https://mat212fa24.netlify.app/syllabus.html#academic-honesty) section of the syllabus

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}

-   You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.
-   There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:[^1]
    -   \(1\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate---rather than hinder---learning.
    -   \(2\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.

[^1]: These guiding principles are based on [*Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpCeTyiWCPQ9MNCsFeKMDQLSTsg1oKfNIH6MzoSFXqQ/preview) developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.[↩︎](https://sta101-f23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#fnref1)

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}

✅ **AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code.

❌ **No AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, AI is [**not**]{.underline} permitted for writing narrative on assignments.

::: callout-important
In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.
