# Regression analysis

## What is regression analysis?

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}
> "In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when ***the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')***. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed."

## Course FAQ

**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**

A - Introductory statistics or probability course at Duke

. . .

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**

A - Yes. We will use the computing language R for analysis, Quarto for writing up results, and GitHub for version control and collaboration

. . .

**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory of regression?**

A - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of simple linear regression. There a 0.5-credit course [STA 211: Mathematics of Regression](https://stat.duke.edu/courses/mathematics-regression) to take simultaneously or after this course to dive into more of the mathematics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Course learning objectives

-   Analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.

-   Fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.

-   Assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.

-   Use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

-   Communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience.

# Having a successful semester in STA 210

## Five tips for success

1.  Complete all the preparation work (readings and videos) before class.

2.  Ask questions.

3.  Do the homeworks and labs and get started on homework early when possible.

4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.

5.  Stay up-to-date on announcements (posted on Sakai & sent via email).

## Learning during a pandemic

I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.

-   You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I likely know someone who can.

-   I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded.
