*Robert Santos received an MA in Statistics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He served as president of the American Statistical Association in 2021. As a survey researcher, he worked at National Opinion Research Center (NORC, University of Chicago) and the Urban Institute in Washington, DC.*

*As a Mexican-American, he is the first non-white person to serve as the Director of the US Census Bureau (appointed by Joe Biden and approved by the US Senate in 2022).*

## Robert Santos {.midi}

*Santos is a survey researcher with much of his recent focus on the US Census. In particular, he has written extensively about miscounting particular groups of people in the Census and the relationship between race and ethnicity in surveys.*

From his article "[Is It Time to Postpone the 2020 Census?](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/it-time-postpone-2020-census)**"** (written during his time at the Urban Institute)

> "This would create a worst-case scenario when it comes to political representation and allocation of federal resources...And the 2020 counts would then be baked in to population projections used to calibrate federal statistics and surveys, thus informing federal funds allocations and eligibility thresholds for the next 10 years.

# Questions from last class?

## Computational set up

```{r packages}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

# load packages
library(tidyverse)   # for data wrangling and visualization
library(tidymodels)  # for modeling
library(openintro)   # for the duke_forest dataset
library(scales)      # for pretty axis labels
library(knitr)       # for pretty tables
library(kableExtra)  # also for pretty tables
library(patchwork)   # arrange plots

# set default theme and larger font size for ggplot2
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 20))
```

# Model conditions

## Model conditions

1.  **Linearity:** There is a linear relationship between the outcome and predictor variables
2.  **Constant variance:** The variability of the errors is equal for all values of the predictor variable
3.  **Normality:** The errors follow a normal distribution
4.  **Independence:** The errors are independent from each other

## Augmented data frame

```{r}
#| echo: true

df_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(price ~ area, data = duke_forest)

df_aug <- augment(df_fit$fit)

head(df_aug)

```

# Model evaluation

## Two statistics {.small}

::: incremental
-   **R-squared**, $R^2$ : Percentage of variability in the outcome explained by the regression model (in the context of SLR, the predictor)

    $$
    R^2 = Cor(x,y)^2 = Cor(y, \hat{y})^2
    $$

-   **Root mean square error, RMSE**: A measure of the average error (average difference between observed and predicted values of the outcome)

    $$
    RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n}}
    $$
:::

. . .

::: question
What indicates a good model fit? Higher or lower $R^2$? Higher or lower RMSE?
:::

## $R^2$

::: incremental
-   Ranges between 0 (terrible predictor) and 1 (perfect predictor)

-   Has no units

-   Calculate with `rsq()` using the augmented data:

```{r}
#| echo: true

rsq(df_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
```
:::

## Interpreting $R^2$ {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false
df_fit_rsq <- round(glance(df_fit)$r.squared * 100, 1)
```

::: poll
üó≥Ô∏è **Discussion**

::: midi
::: poll
The $R^2$ of the model for price from area of houses in Duke Forest is `r df_fit_rsq`%. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this value?
:::

1.  Area correctly predicts `r df_fit_rsq`% of price for houses in Duke Forest.
2.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the variability in price for houses in Duke Forest can be explained by area.
3.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the variability in area for houses in Duke Forest can be explained by price
4.  `r df_fit_rsq`% of the time price for houses in Duke Forest can be predicted by area.
:::
:::

## Alternative approach for $R^2$

Alternatively, use `glance()` to construct a single row summary of the model fit, including $R^2$:

```{r}
#| echo: true

glance(df_fit)
```

<br>

. . .

```{r}
glance(df_fit)$r.squared
```

## RMSE

::: incremental
-   Ranges between 0 (perfect predictor) and infinity (terrible predictor)

-   Same units as the response variable

-   Calculate with `rmse()` using the augmented data:

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true

    rmse(df_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
    ```

-   The value of RMSE is not very meaningful on its own, but it's useful for comparing across models (more on this when we get to regression with multiple predictors)
:::

## Obtaining $R^2$ and RMSE

::: incremental
-   Use `rsq()` and `rmse()`, respectively

    ```{r}
    #| echo: true
    #| eval: false

    rsq(df_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
    rmse(df_aug, truth = price, estimate = .fitted)
    ```

-   First argument: data frame containing `truth` and `estimate` columns

-   Second argument: name of the column containing `truth` (observed outcome)

-   Third argument: name of the column containing `estimate` (predicted outcome)

# Questions about SLR? {.midi}

We have officially completed simple linear regression! What remaining questions do you have? Please submit all questions by Thu, Sep 28. These questions will be used to make the Exam 01 review.

*Note: Questions must be specific. For example:*

-   *‚ùå How do you do simulation-based hypothesis testing?*
-   *‚úÖ Why does a small p-value correspond to rejecting the null hypothesis?*
