# Getting started on Lab 01

## Do you have the `lab-01` repo?

-   Go to the GitHub course organization: <https://github.com/sta210-fa23>

-   You should see a repo with the prefix **`lab-01-`** followed by your GitHub username

-   If you do not have this repo

    -   [Click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/5kU1kpeo) to create your lab-01 repo, AND

    -   Go to the course organization and accept the invite in the banner at the top of the page. If you do not see the invite, [click here](https://forms.office.com/r/S1eSDTjB6M) to (re)submit your GitHub username.

## Demo

**Follow along as your TA demonstrates the following:**

-   Configure Git using SSH

-   Clone repo (using SSH) and start new project in RStudio

-   Render document and produce PDF

-   Update name in YAML in the Quarto doc

    -   Render, commit, push changes to GitHub

    -   See updates in your GitHub repo

-   Add an R code chunk to the Quarto doc

## Tips for working on lab

-   You do not have to finish the lab in class, they will always be due **Friday (Tuesday labs) or Sunday (Thursday labs)**. One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early (particularly once you start working on teams); use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

## **When you're done with lab**

-   Make sure all your final changes have been pushed to your GitHub repo

Submit the PDF of your responses to [**Gradescope**](https://www.gradescope.com/)

-   You can access Gradescope through Sakai or the course website

-   Login using your Duke NetID credentials

-   See Lab 01 instructions for details on submitting an assignment on Gradescope

## Lab 01: Access to public parks

-   Today's lab focuses on exploratory data analysis and simple linear regression. Read the lab instructions carefully.

-   There are markers throughout suggesting when to render, commit, and push changes to GitHub. These are to help you start using version control in your workflow.

-   There are points for having a neatly formatted document and implementing a reproducible workflow. See the Workflow & Formatting section in the Lab 01 instructions.
