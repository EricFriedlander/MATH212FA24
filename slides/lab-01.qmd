# Getting started on Lab 01

## Do you have the `lab-01` repo?

-   Go to the GitHub course organization: [https://github.com/sta210-fa22](https://github.com/sta210-fa23){.uri}

-   You should see a repo with the prefix **`lab-01-`** followed by your GitHub username

-   If you do not have this repo, please let your TA know!

## Demo

**Follow along as your TA demonstrates the following:**

-   Configure Git using SSH

-   Clone repo (using SSH) and start new project in RStudio

-   Render document and produce PDF

-   Update name in YAML

    -   Render, commit, push changes to GitHub

    -   See updates in your GitHub repo

-   Add a R code chunk

## Tips for working on lab

-   You do not have to finish the lab in class, they will always be due the following **Friday (Tuesday labs) or Sunday (Thursday labs)**. One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.

-   Do not pressure each other to finish early (particularly once you start working on teams); use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

## **When you're done with lab**

-   Make sure all your final changes have been pushed to your GitHub repo

-   Submit the PDF of your responses to [**Gradescope**](https://www.gradescope.com/)

    -   You can access Gradescope through Sakai or the course website

    -   Login using your Duke NetID credentials

    -   See Lab 01 instructions for details on submitting an assignment on Gradescope
