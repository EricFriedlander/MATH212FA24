Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclusive community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website, sta210-fa23.netlify.app.\nLinks to Zoom meetings may be found in Sakai. Periodic announcements will be sent via email and will also be available through Ed Discussion and Sakai Announcements. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nGetting help in the course\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours1 to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. You are encouraged to use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the class discussion forum Ed Discussion. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Ed Discussion before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, you are encouraged to respond!\n\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have questions about assignment extensions or accommodations, please email sta210@duke.edu. This email address is accessible to me and the head TA. Please see Assignment extensions for more information. If you have any other questions that are not appropriate for the public forum, you are welcome to email me directly at maria.tackett@duke.edu. If you email me, please include “STA 210” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 210 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\nCheck out the Support page for more resources."

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone."

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication Exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on making a good-faith effort in attempting all questions covered in class. You are welcome to, but not required, to work on AEs beyond lecture. Successful on-time effort on at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade. Because AEs are intended for in-class activities, there are no extensions given on AEs.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation and communication. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes in-class component and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homework, and lab assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work through a written report and presentation. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\n\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:2 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 1 day late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed as in-class activities to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email sta210@duke.edu before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nAssignment extensions\nSam Rosen (sta210@duke.edu) will serve as the Head TA this semester. Among many things, Sam’s role is to handle all assignment extension questions. This includes answering questions about the late work policy, along with granting extensions based on the documented arrangements for accommodations and extenuating circumstances via the one-time late waiver or documentation from the Academic Dean. Please see Late work policy and Waiver for extenuating circumstances for more information about these policies.\nPlease direct all questions about late work policies to sta210@duke.edu. This email will be directed to Sam and myself. This email address only accept emails from Duke email addresses.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your lab team. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your lab TA and teammates about how you can make up your contribution. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your lab TA and teammates ahead of time.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\n\nAttendance Policy Related to COVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at coronavirus.duke.edu.\nTo keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at forms.office.com/r/FbRXJm4Ln1. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These recordings will be available until 10am the day of the exam."

It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or ‘predictors’). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion variable’) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.”\n\nSource: Wikipedia (previous definition)"

It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOpen the Quarto (.qmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes\nNow, go to the Git pane in your RStudio instance. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff. This shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\nIf you’re happy with these changes, we’ll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, “updated author name”) in the Commit message box. Finally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\nIn the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\nNow let’s make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you’re good to go!\n\n\nPush changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged your commit to be pushed. click on Push."

If you are attending a single talk or panel, it must be at least 30 minutes to count towards the statistics experience. The event can be in-person or online.\n\n\nCategory 2: Talk with a statistician/ data scientist\nTalk with someone who uses statistics in their daily work. This could include a professor, professional in industry, graduate student, etc.\n\n\nCategory 3: Listen to a podcast / watch video\nListen to a podcast or watch a video about statistics and data science. The podcast or video must be at least 30 minutes to count towards the statistics experience. A few suggestions are below:\n\nStats + Stories Podcast\nCausal Inference Podcast\nFiveThirtyEight Model Talk\nrstudio::conf talks\n\n2022 conference\n2021 conference\n2020 conference\n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. You may listen to other podcasts or watch other statistics/data science videos not included on this list. Ask your professor if you are unsure whether a particular podcast or video will count towards the statistics experience.\n\n\nCategory 4: Participate in a data science competition or challenge\nParticipate in a statistics or data science competition. You can participate individually or with a team.\n\n\nCategory 5: Read a book on statistics/data science\nThere are a lot of books about statistics, data science, and related topics. A few suggestions are below. If you decide to read a book that isn’t on this list, ask your professor to make sure it counts toward the experience. Many of these books are available through Duke library.\n\nWeapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil\nHow Charts Lie: Getting Smarter about Visual Information by Alberto Cairo\nThe Theory that Would Not Die by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\nThe Art of Statistics: How to learn from data by David Spiegelhalter\nThe Signal and the Noise: Why so many predictions fail - but some don’t by Nate Silver\nList of books about data science ethics\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nCategory 6: TidyTuesday\nYou may also participate in a TidyTuesday challenge. New data sets are announced on Monday afternoons.You can find more information about TidyTuesday and see the data in the TidyTuesday GitHub repo.\nA few guidelines:\n✅ Create a GitHub repo for your TidyTuesday submission. Your repo should include\n\nThe R Markdown file with all the code needed to reproduce your visualization.\nA README that includes an image of your final visualization and a short summary (~ 1 paragraph) about your visualization.\n\n✅ The visualization should include features or customization that are beyond what we’ve done in class .\n✅ Include the link to your GitHub repo in the slide summarizing your experience.\n\n\nCategory 7: Coding out loud\nWatch an episode of Coding out loud (either live or pre-recorded) and work through the project.\nA few guidelines:\n✅ Create a GitHub repo for your Coding out loud submission. Your repo should include\n\nThe Quarto file with all the code needed to reproduce your visualization.\nA README that includes an image of your final visualization and a short summary (~ 1 paragraph) about your visualization.\n\n✅ The final product (visualuzation, table, etc.) should include features or customization that are beyond what was achieved in the Coding out loud episode.\n✅ Include the link to your GitHub repo in the slide summarizing your experience."

    "text": "Data sources\n\nSome resources that may be helpful as you find data:\n\nR Data Sources for Regression Analysis\nFiveThirtyEight data\nTidyTuesday\n\n\n\nOther data repositories\n\nWorld Health Organization\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research\nInternational Monetary Fund\nGeneral Social Survey\nUnited Nations Data\nUnited Nations Statistics Division\nU.K. Data\nU.S. Data\nU.S. Census Data\nEuropean Statistics\nStatistics Canada\nPew Research\nUNICEF\nCDC\nWorld Bank\nElection Studies\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\nAsk questions if any of the expectations are unclear.\nCode: In your write up your code should be hidden (echo = FALSE) so that your document is neat and easy to read. However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your Qmd file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.\n\nException: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcome to show that portion.\n\nMerge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.\nMake sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.\n\n\n\nFormatting + communication tips\n\nSuppress Code, Warnings, & Messages\n\nInclude the following code in a code chunk at the top of your .qmd file to suppress all code, warnings, and other messages. Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\nAn alternative approach is to add the following code to the YAML:\n\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section. Make sure there is a space between the last # and the title, so the header renders correctly. For example, ###Section Title will not render as header, but ### Section Title will.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\n\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\nResize individual figures: Use the code chunk header {r plot1, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}, replacing plot1 with a meaningful label and the height and width with values appropriate for your write up.\nResize all figures: Include the fig_width and fig_height options in your YAML header as shown below:\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your Title\"\nauthor: \"Team Name + Group Members\"\noutput: \n  pdf_document:\n    fig_width: 5\n    fig_height: 3\n---\nReplace the height and width values with values appropriate for your write up.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\n\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\nIf you’re using base R function, i.e. when using the emplogit functions, put the code par(mfrow = c(rows,columns)) before the code to make the plots. For example, par(mfrow = c(2,3)) will arrange plots in a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\nUse coord_flip() to flip the x and y axes on the plot. This is useful if you a bar plot with an x-axis that is difficult to read due to overlapping text.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  count(manufacturer) |&gt;\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), y = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\nExploring RStudio’s Visual Markdown Editor\nR for Data Science\nQuarto documentation:\n\nQuarto PDF Basics\nPresentations in Quarto\n\nData visualization\n\nggplot2 Reference\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nData Visualization: A Practice Introduction\nPatchwork R Package"
