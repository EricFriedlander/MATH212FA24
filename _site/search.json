Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclusive community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website, sta210-fa23.netlify.app.\nLinks to Zoom meetings may be found in Sakai. Periodic announcements will be sent via email and will also be available through Ed Discussion and Sakai Announcements. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\n\n\nGetting help in the course\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours1 to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. You are encouraged to use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the class discussion forum Ed Discussion. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Ed Discussion before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, you are encouraged to respond!\n\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have questions about assignment extensions or accommodations, please email sta210@duke.edu. This email address is accessible to me and the head TA. Please see Assignment extensions for more information. If you have any other questions that are not appropriate for the public forum, you are welcome to email me directly at maria.tackett@duke.edu. If you email me, please include “STA 210” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 210 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\nCheck out the Support page for more resources."

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone."

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication Exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on making a good-faith effort in attempting all questions covered in class. You are welcome to, but not required, to work on AEs beyond lecture. Successful on-time effort on at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade. Because AEs are intended for in-class activities, there are no extensions given on AEs.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation and communication. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include a closed-notes in-class component and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homework, and lab assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work through a written report and presentation. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\n\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat use of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite that the code came from ChatGPT. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you you may use generative AI as a resource to help as you complete assignments but not a tool to complete the assignments. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn it in and it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity(e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 1 day late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed as in-class activities to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email sta210@duke.edu before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nAssignment extensions\nSam Rosen (sta210@duke.edu) will serve as the Head TA this semester. Among many things, Sam’s role is to handle all assignment extension questions. This includes answering questions about the late work policy, along with granting extensions based on the documented arrangements for accommodations and extenuating circumstances via the one-time late waiver or documentation from the Academic Dean. Please see Late work policy and Waiver for extenuating circumstances for more information about these policies.\nPlease direct all questions about late work policies to sta210@duke.edu. This email will be directed to Sam and myself. This email address only accept emails from Duke email addresses.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture and labs. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings are available upon request for students who have an excused absence. See the Lecture recording request policy for more detail. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture. Labs dedicated to completing the lab assignment and collaborating with your lab team. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your lab TA and teammates about how you can make up your contribution. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your lab TA and teammates ahead of time.\nMore details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\n\nAttendance Policy Related to COVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at coronavirus.duke.edu.\nTo keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\n\nLecture recording request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at forms.office.com/r/FbRXJm4Ln1. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These recordings will be available until 10am the day of the exam."

Use set.seed(1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the prop = argument in the initial_split() function to specify the proportion of observations in the training data.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nBelow is a recipe for a model that uses the characteristics of candy to understand variability in the win percentage. The lines of the recipe code are labeled Line 1 - Line 8. Describe what each line of code does. The explanation should be written comprehensively and specifically enough that someone could replicate the data manipulation steps based on your description.\nFor example, if a line of code is step_center(X), a comprehensive and specific explanation something similar to the following: “This line of code mean centers the variable \\(X\\) by subtracting \\(\\bar{X}\\) from each value of \\(X\\) in the training data.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the Recipes Function Reference page as a resource to learn more about the step_ functions.\n\n\n\n#Line 1\ncandy_rec &lt;- recipe(winpercent ~ ., data = candy_train) |&gt; \n#Line 2\n  update_role(competitorname, new_role = \"ID\") |&gt; \n# Line 3\n  step_cut(sugarpercent, breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1)) |&gt; \n#Line 4\n  step_mutate(pricepercent = pricepercent * 100) |&gt; \n#Line 5\n  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) |&gt; \n#Line 6\n  step_interact(terms =~ pricepercent:chocolate) |&gt; \n#Line 7\n  step_rm(fruity, caramel, peanutyalmondy, nougat, hard, bar, pluribus, crispedricewafer) |&gt; \n#Line 8\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) \n\n\n\nExercise 3\nFill in the code to use prep and bake for a preview of what will happen when the recipe in Exercise 2 is applied.\n\ncandy_rec |&gt;\n  prep() |&gt;\n  bake(_____) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nHow many terms (not including the intercept) will be in the model produced by this recipe?\n\n\nExercise 4\nSpecify the model, build the model workflow using the recipe in Exercise 2, and fit the model to the training data. Neatly display the model using 3 digits.\n\n\nExercise 5\nInterpret the following in the context of the data:\n\nIntercept\nCoefficient of sugarpercent_X.0.75.1.\nCoefficient of pricepercent_x_chocolateTRUE\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nLet’s consider another model. Use the recipe() workflow to fit a new model that meets the following criteria:\n\nIncludes variables chocolate, pricepercent, crispedricewafer, pluribus, sugarpercent\nUpdate pricepercent so it ranges from 0 to 100 (instead of 0 to 1)\nMakes sugarpercent a factor where the levels equal the four quartiles: 0 - 0.25, 0.25 - 0.50, 0.50 - 0.75, 0.75 - 1\nIncludes the interaction between pricepercent and pluribus\n\nNeatly display the model using 3 digits.\n\n\nExercise 7\nCalculate \\(R^2\\), Adjusted \\(R^2\\), AIC, and BIC for the models fit in Exercise 4 and the Exercise 6.\n\n\nExercise 8\nConsider the model from Exercise 4 “Model 1” and the model fit in Exercise 6 “Model 2”. State the model you would select based on each of the criteria below. Briefly explain your response.\n\n\\(R^2\\)\nAdjusted \\(R^2\\)\nAIC\nBIC\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nUse RMSE to evaluate the predictive performance of each model on the testing data. Which model would you choose based on RMSE?\n\n\nExercise 10\n\nWhich model do you choose after taking into account all the model evaluation statistics in Exercises 9 and 10? Briefly explain your response.\nUse the model you selected to describe what generally makes a good candy, i.e., one with a high win percentage."

It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.

This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff. This shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\nIf you’re happy with these changes, we’ll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, “updated author name”) in the Commit message box. Finally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\nIn the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\nNow let’s make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you’re good to go!\n\n\nPush changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged your commit to be pushed. click on Push."

We’ll call the resulting data frame office_episodes.\nThe two tasks are as follows:\n\nTask 1. Identify episodes where the word “halloween”, “valentine”, or “christmas” were ever mentioned, using variables you created in Exercise 1.\nTask 2. Calculate the percentage of lines spoken by Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight for each episode of The Office.\n\nBelow are instructions and starter code to get you started with these tasks.\n\nStart by grouping theoffice data by season, episode, episode_name, imdb_rating, total_votes, and air_date. (These variables, except for season have the same value for each given episode, hence grouping by them allows us to make sure they appear in the output of this pipeline.)\nUse summarize() to calculate the desired features at the season-episode level.\nTask 1:\n\nCalculate the number of lines per season per episode. You can might name this new variable n_lines.\nThen, calculate the proportion of lines in that episode spoken by each of the four characters Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight. Name these new variables lines_jim, lines_pam, lines_michael, and lines_dwight, respectively.\n\nTask 2:\n\nCreate a variable called halloween that sums up the 1s in halloween_mention at the season-episode level and takes on the value \"yes\" if the sum is greater than or equal to 1, or \"no\" otherwise.\nDo something similar for new variables valentine and christmas as well based on values from valentine_mention and christmas_mention.\n\nFinish up your summarize() statement by dropping the groups, so the resulting data frame is no longer grouped. Additionally, remove n_lines (we won’t use that variable in our analysis, we only calculated it as an intermediary step).\n\n\noffice_episodes &lt;- theoffice |&gt;\n  group_by(___) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    n_lines = n(),\n    lines_jim = sum(character == \"___\") / n_lines,\n    lines_pam = ___,\n    lines_michael = ___,\n    lines_dwight = ___,\n    halloween = if_else(sum(___) &gt;= 1, \"yes\", \"no\"),\n    valentine = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    christmas = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(-n_lines)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy summarize() and not mutate()? We use mutate() to add / modify a column of a data frame. The output data frame always has the same number of rows as the input data frame. On the other hand, we use summarize() to reduce the data frame to either a single row (single summary statistic) or one row per each group (summary statistics at the group level).\nAnd what about that .groups argument in summarize? You could try running your summarize() step without it first. You’ll see that R print out a message saying “summarize() has grouped output by season, episode. You can override using the .groups argument.” summarize() will only drop the last group. So if you want a data frame that doesn’t have a grouping structure as a result of a summarize(), you can explicitly ask for that with .groups = \"drop\". Before you proceed, read the documentation for summarize(), and specifically the explanation for the .groups argument to prepare yourself for future instances where you might see this type of message.\n\n\n\nTeam Member 1: Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF.

If you are not matching these numbers or columns, go back and try to figure out where you went wrong. Or ask your TA for help!\n\n\n\nExploratory data analysis\nThis would be a good place to conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Portions of the abstract are below:\n\nObjectives\nTo examine the relationships between tea consumption habits and incident neurocognitive disorders (NCD) and explore potential effect modification by gender and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype.\nParticipants\n\n\n957 community-living Chinese elderly who were cognitively intact at baseline.\n\n\nMeasurements\n\n\nWe collected tea consumption information at baseline from 2003 to 2005 and ascertained incident cases of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) from 2006 to 2010. Odds ratio (OR) of association were calculated in logistic regression models that adjusted for potential confounders.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nA total of 72 incident NCD cases were identified from the cohort. Tea intake was associated with lower risk of incident NCD, independent of other risk factors. Reduced NCD risk was observed for both green tea (OR=0.43) and black/oolong tea (OR=0.53) and appeared to be influenced by the changing of tea consumption habit at follow-up. Using consistent nontea consumers as the reference, only consistent tea consumers had reduced risk of NCD (OR=0.39). Stratified analyses indicated that tea consumption was associated with reduced risk of NCD among females (OR=0.32) and APOE e4 carriers (OR=0.14) but not males and non APOE e4 carriers.\n\n\nExercise 1\nThe odds ratios reported in the abstract are the adjusted odds ratios, i.e., the odds ratios after adjusting for potential confounders such as age, pre-existing health conditions, diet, and behavioral factors. Interpret the following odds ratios from the abstract. Write the interpretations in the context of the data.\n\nOR = 0.39\nOR = 0.32\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nAn online article based on the results of Feng et al. states the following:\n\n“And for people who carry a gene that puts them at higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease (the APOE e4 gene), enjoying the beverage is even more important: Daily tea consumption could reduce their risk of cognitive decline by up to 86 percent.”\n\nIs this statement supported by the results of the study?

He states the following from the model:\n\n“A one-point increase in the unemployment rate raises an individual’s odds of becoming long-term unemployed by 35 percent.”\n\nWhat is the coefficient for unemployment rate in this model? Show how you calculated the answer."

    "text": "Rearrest risk algorithms\nIn the paper “Employing Standardized Risk Assessment in Pretrial Release Decisions: Association With Criminal Justice Outcomes and Racial Equity” Marlowe et al. (2020) analyze the risk predictions produced by a black-box algorithm used to determine whether a defendant is considered “high risk” of being rearrested if they are released while awaiting trial. Such algorithms are used by judges in some states to help determine whether or not defendants are released while awaiting trial.\nThe authors examine the algorithm’s risk predictions and whether a person was rearrested for over 500 defendants released pretrial in a southern state. For each person, the algorithm produced one of the following predictions: “High Risk” or “Low Risk”. The observed outcome was “Rearrested” or “Not Rearrested”. Below are some results from the analysis:\n\nSensitivity: 86%\nSpecificity: 24%\nPositive predictive power: 57%\nNegative predictive power: 60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nPositive Predictive Power: P(Y = 1 | Y classified as 1 from the model)\nNegative Predictive Power: P(Y = 0 | Y classified as 0 from the model)\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nExplain what each of the following mean in the context of the analysis:\n\nSensitivity\nSpecificity\nPositive predictive power\nNegative predictive power\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nWhat is the false positive rate? What does this value mean in the context of the analysis?\n\n\nExercise 7\nThe AUC for this algorithm is 0.55. Based on this value, do you think this algorithm a good fit for the population examined in the paper? Why or why not?"

That is your final project.\nThe goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing. The data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.\nChoose the data based on your group’s interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.\nAll analyses must be done in RStudio, and all components of the project must be reproducible (with the exception of the presentation).\n\n\nYou will work on the project with your lab groups.\nThe four primary deliverables for the final project are\n\nA written, reproducible report detailing your analysis\nA GitHub repository corresponding to your report\nSlides + a video presentation\nFormal peer review on another team’s project\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify 2 - 3 data sets you’re interested in potentially using for the final project. If you’re unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources on the Tips + resources page as a starting point. It may also help to think of topics you’re interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.\nThe purpose of submitting project ideas is to give you time to find data for the project and to make sure you have a data set that can help set you up for a successful project. Therefore, you must use one of the data sets submitted as a topic idea, unless otherwise notified by the teaching team.\nThe data sets should meet the following criteria:\n\nAt least 500 observations\nAt least 10 columns\nAt least 6 of the columns must be useful and unique predictor variables.\n\nIdentifier variables such as “name”, “social security number”, etc. are not useful predictor variables.\nIf you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. “state abbreviation” and “state name”), then they are not unique predictors.\n\nAt least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.\n\nThe response variable can be quantitative or categorical.\n\nA mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.\nObservations should reasonably meet the independence condition. Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.\nYou may not use data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAsk a member of the teaching team if you’re unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.\n\n\nFor each data set, include the following:\n\n\n\nState the source of the data set.\nDescribe when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data)\nDescribe the observations and the general characteristics being measured in the data\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe a research question you’re interested in answering using this data.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the glimpse function to provide an overview of the data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll work will go inside the topic-ideas folder. Write your responses in topic-ideas.qmd and put the data sets in the data folder within topic-ideas.\n\nSubmit the PDF of the topic ideas to Gradescope. Mark all pages associated with each data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Topic Ideas portion of the project is worth 10 points. It will be graded based on meeting the criteria stated above for 2 proposed data sets.\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the project proposal is to help you think about your analysis strategy early and thoroughly explore the data.\nInclude the following in the proposal:\n\n\nThe introduction section includes\n\nan introduction to the subject matter you’re investigating\nthe motivation for your research question (citing any relevant literature)\nthe primary research question you are interested in exploring\nyour team’s hypotheses regarding the research question\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will describe the data set. This includes\n\ndescription of the observations in the data set\ndescription of how the data were originally collected (not how you found the data but how the original curator of the data collected it).\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will explore the data. This includes using , visualizations and summary statistics to describe the following:\n\nunivariate distribution of the response variable\nunivariate distributions of the potential predictor variables\nrelationships between the response and predictors\nrelationships between predictors\npotential interaction effects you’re interested in exploring\n\nIn this section, you will also describe any data cleaning you need to do to prepare for modeling, such as imputing missing values, collapsing levels for categorical predictors, creating new variables, summarizing data, etc.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will provide a brief overview of your analysis approach. This includes:\n\ndescription of the response variable and list of potential predictors\nregression model technique (multiple linear regression or logistic regression)\n\n\n\n\nSubmit a data dictionary for all the variables in your data set in the README of the data folder. You do not need to include the data dictionary in the PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll work will go inside the proposal folder. Write your responses in proposal.qmd and put the data set and the data dictionary in the data folder.\n\nSubmit the PDF of the proposal to Gradescope. Mark all pages of the document.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anticipated length, including all graphs, tables, narrative, etc., is 3 - 6 pages; it may not exceed 7 pages.\nThe proposal is with 15 points and will be graded based on accurately and comprehensively addressing the criteria stated above. Points will be assigned based on a holistic review of the project proposal.\n\nExcellent (14 - 15 points) : All required elements are completed and are accurate. There is a thorough exploration of the data and the team has demonstrated a careful and thoughtful approach exploring the data and preparing it for analysis. The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.\nStrong: (11 - 13 points) Requirements are mostly met, but there are some elements that are incomplete or inaccurate. Some minor revision of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\nSatisfactory (8 - 10 points): Requirements partially met, but there are some elements that are incomplete and/or inaccurate. Major revision of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\nNeeds Improvement (7 or fewer points points): Requirements are largely unmet, and there are large elements that are incomplete and/or inaccurate. Substantial revisions of the work required before team is ready for modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Round 1 submission is an opportunity to receive detailed feedback on your analysis and written report. The feedback will only be on the content that is submitted, so more “complete” drafts will receive more detailed feedback. At this stage, you will also be notified of the grade you would receive at that point. You will have the option to keep the grade (and thus you don’t need to turn in an updated report) or resubmit the written report by the final submission deadline for grading.\nTo submit the draft:\n1. Push the updated written-report.qmd and written-report.pdf to your GitHub repo.\n2. Open an issue with the title “Round 1 Submission”. You can use the template issue in the GitHub repo. Make sure I am tagged in the issue (@matackett), so I receive notification of your Round 1 submission. See Creating an issue from a repository for instructions on opening an issue. Please ask a member of the teaching team for assistance if you need help opening the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must complete both steps by Tuesday, November 22, 11:59pm to receive preliminary feedback.\n\nReports submitted after that date will not receive preliminary feedback.\n\n\nNote that this is optional, so there is no grading penalty for turning in nothing for the Round 1 submission. Due to time constraints at the end of the semester, only high-level feedback will be given for the reports submitted at the final written report deadline in December.\n\n\n\nYour written report must be completed in the written-report.qmd file and must be reproducible. All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBefore you finalize your write up, make sure the code chunks are not visible and all messages and warnings are suppressed.\n\n\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on GitHub.\nThe PDF you submit must match the .qmd in your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\n\n\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions.

The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report.

The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions.

It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or ‘predictors’). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion variable’) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.”\n\nSource: Wikipedia (previous definition)"

However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your Qmd file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.\n\nException: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcome to show that portion.\n\nMerge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.\nMake sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.\n\n\n\nFormatting + communication tips\n\nSuppress Code, Warnings, & Messages\n\nInclude the following code in a code chunk at the top of your .qmd file to suppress all code, warnings, and other messages. Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\nAn alternative approach is to add the following code to the YAML:\n\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n\n\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section. Make sure there is a space between the last # and the title, so the header renders correctly. For example, ###Section Title will not render as header, but ### Section Title will.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\n\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\nResize individual figures: Use the code chunk header {r plot1, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}, replacing plot1 with a meaningful label and the height and width with values appropriate for your write up.\nResize all figures: Include the fig_width and fig_height options in your YAML header as shown below:\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Your Title\"\nauthor: \"Team Name + Group Members\"\noutput: \n  pdf_document:\n    fig_width: 5\n    fig_height: 3\n---\nReplace the height and width values with values appropriate for your write up.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\n\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\nIf you’re using base R function, i.e. when using the emplogit functions, put the code par(mfrow = c(rows,columns)) before the code to make the plots. For example, par(mfrow = c(2,3)) will arrange plots in a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns.\n\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\nUse coord_flip() to flip the x and y axes on the plot. This is useful if you a bar plot with an x-axis that is difficult to read due to overlapping text.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg |&gt;\n  count(manufacturer) |&gt;\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), y = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\nExploring RStudio’s Visual Markdown Editor\nR for Data Science\nQuarto documentation:\n\nQuarto PDF Basics\nPresentations in Quarto\n\nData visualization\n\nggplot2 Reference\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nData Visualization: A Practice Introduction\nPatchwork R Package"
