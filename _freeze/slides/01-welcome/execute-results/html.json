It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when ***the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')***. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.\"\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) (previous definition)\n:::\n\nNote:  I don't really like the terms \"independent\" and \"dependent\" variables\n\n\n## Examples of regression in practice\n\n-   [New Yorkers Will Pay \\$56 A Month To Trim A Minute Off Their Commute](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/new-yorkers-will-pay-56-a-month-to-trim-a-minute-off-their-commute/)\n\n-   [How FiveThirtyEight's 2020 Presidential Forecast Works --- And What's Different Because Of COVID-19](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/)\n\n-   [Effect of Forensic Evidence on Criminal Justice Case Processing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12020)\n\n-   [Why it's so freaking hard to make a good COVID-19 model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/) (from March 2020)\n\n# MAT 212\n\n## Course FAQ {.midi}\n\n**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**\n\nA - Introductory statistics or previous experience with mathematics at a level that would allow you to learn intro stats concepts relatively easily\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we be doing computing?**\n\nA - Yes. We will use the computing language R for analysis and Quarto for writing up results.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Am I expected to have experience using any of these tools?**\n\nA - No. I do not expect you to have any exposure to R and certainly not Quarto.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory of regression?**\n\nA - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics of simple linear regression.\n\n## Course learning objectives {.midi}\n\nBy the end of the semester, you will be able to...\n\n-   analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships.\n\n-   use R to fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.\n\n-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.\n\n-   use Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.\n\n-   effectively communicate statistical results through writing and oral presentations.\n\n## Course Topics\n\n:::{.question}\nWhat is a quantitative and what is a categorical variable?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n|**Chapter** | **Response** | **Predictor/Explanatory** |\n|:------------:|--------------|------------------|\n|1-2      | Quantitative | Single Quantitative|\n|3-4      | Quantitative | Multiple Quantitative|\n|5      | Quantitative | Single Categorical|\n|6-8      | Quantitative | Multiple Categorical|\n|9     | Categorical | Single Quant/Cat|\n|10     | Categorical | Multiple Quant/Cat|\n|11     | Both | Both|\n\n\n# Course overview\n\n## Course toolkit {.midi}\n\n-   **Course website**: [mat212fa24.netlify.app](https://mat212fa24.netlify.app/)\n    -   Central hub for the course!\n    -   **Tour of the website**\n-   **Canvas**: [cofi.instructure.com](https://cofi.instructure.com/)\n    -   Gradebook\n    -   Announcements\n\n\n## Computing toolkit {.midi}\n\n::: {.fragment fragment-index=\"1\"}\n![](images/01/rstudio.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio logo\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"5.61in\" height=\"1.6in\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment fragment-index=\"2\"}\n-   All analyses using R, a statistical programming language\n\n-   Write reproducible reports in Quarto\n\n-   Access RStudio through [College of Idaho posit Workbench](https://rstudio.collegeofidaho.edu/)\n  \n  + Use your College of Idaho email and password\n:::\n\n# Activities + assessments\n\n## Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform\n\n::: small\n::: incremental\n-   **Prepare:** Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by completing the readings (and sometimes watching the videos)\n\n-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, team meetings\n\n-   **Practice:** Practice applying statistical concepts and computing with application exercises during lecture, graded for completion\n\n-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data\n\n    -   Homework assignments (individual)\n\n    -   Two exams\n    \n    -   Oral R quiz\n\n    -   Final group project\n:::\n:::\n\n## Grading\n\n| Category              | Percentage |\n|-----------------------|------------|\n| Homework              | 35%        |\n| Final project         | 25%        |\n| Exam 01               | 15%        |\n| Exam 02               | 15%        |\n| Application Exercises | 5%         |\n| Oral R Quiz           | 5%         |\n\nSee the [syllabus](https://mat212fa24.netlify.app/syllabus) for details on how the final letter grade will be calculated.\n\n## Support\n\n-   Attend office hours to meet with Prof. Friedlander (Boone 126B)\n    -   M: 2:30-3:30pm\n    -   T: 9:45-10:45am\n    -   W: 1:30-2:30pm\n    -   TH: 1-2pm\n-   Ask and answer questions on course discussion forum\n-   Use email for questions regarding personal matters and/or grades\n-   See the [Course Support](https://mat212fa24.netlify.app/support) page for more details\n\n# Course policies\n\n## Late Homework\n\n-   There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late for the first two days. After 2 days, students will receive a 30% reduction. No homework will be accepted after it is returned to the class\n\n## Late Application Exercises\n\n-   AEs are due three days after the class they are assigned. No late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed as in-class activities to help you prepare for homework. \n\n## Late Exams and Final Project\n\n-   If an application exercise, exam, or final project must be missed due to a school-sponsored event, you must let me know at least a week ahead of time so that we can schedule a time for you to make up the work before you leave. If you must miss a exam or the final project due to illness, you must let me know before class that day so that we can schedule a time for you to take a make-up quiz or exam. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in a 35% penalty the corresponding assignment.  \n\n## Academic integrity {.smaller}\n\n> The College of Idaho maintains that academic honesty and integrity are essential values in the educational process. Operating under an Honor Code philosophy, the College expects conduct rooted in honesty, integrity, and understanding, allowing members of a diverse student body to live together and interact and learn from one another in ways that protect both personal freedom and community standards. Violations of academic honesty are addressed primarily by the instructor and may be referred to the [Student Judicial Board](https://collegeofidaho.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Policies-and-Procedures/Academic-Misconduct).\n\nBy participating in this course, you are agreeing that all your work and conduct will be in accordance with the College of Idaho Honor Code.\n\n## Collaboration & sharing code\n\n-   I have policies! \n\n-   Let's read about them in the [Academic honesty](https://mat212fa24.netlify.app/syllabus.html#academic-honesty) section of the syllabus\n\n## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}\n\n-   You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.\n-   There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:[^1]\n    -   \\(1\\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate---rather than hinder---learning.\n    -   \\(2\\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n[^1]: These guiding principles are based on [*Course Policies related to ChatGPT and other AI Tools*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpCeTyiWCPQ9MNCsFeKMDQLSTsg1oKfNIH6MzoSFXqQ/preview) developed by Joel Gladd, Ph.D.[↩︎](https://sta101-f23.github.io/course-syllabus.html#fnref1)\n\n## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}\n\n✅ **AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code.\n\n❌ **No AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, AI is [**not**]{.underline} permitted for writing narrative on assignments.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n:::\n\n# Having a successful semester in MAT 212\n\n## Five tips for success\n\n1.  Complete all the preparation work (readings and videos) before class.\n\n2.  Ask questions.\n\n3.  Do the homework; get started early when possible.\n\n4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.\n\n5.
