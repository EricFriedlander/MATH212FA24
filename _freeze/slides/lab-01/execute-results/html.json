If you do not see the invite, [click here](https://forms.office.com/r/S1eSDTjB6M) to (re)submit your GitHub username.\n\n## Demo\n\n**Follow along as your TA demonstrates the following:**\n\n-   Configure Git using SSH\n\n-   Clone repo (using SSH) and start new project in RStudio\n\n-   Render document and produce PDF\n\n-   Update name in YAML in the Quarto doc\n\n    -   Render, commit, push changes to GitHub\n\n    -   See updates in your GitHub repo\n\n-   Add an R code chunk to the Quarto doc\n\n## Tips for working on lab\n\n-   You do not have to finish the lab in class, they will always be due **Friday (Tuesday labs) or Sunday (Thursday labs)**. One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.\n\n-   Do not pressure each other to finish early (particularly once you start working on teams); use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.\n\n## **When you're done with lab**\n\n-   Make sure all your final changes have been pushed to your GitHub repo\n\nSubmit the PDF of your responses to [**Gradescope**](https://www.gradescope.com/)\n\n-   You can access Gradescope through Sakai or the course website\n\n-   Login using your Duke NetID credentials\n\n-   See Lab 01 instructions for details on submitting an assignment on Gradescope\n\n## Lab 01: Park access\n\n-   Today's lab focuses on exploratory data analysis and simple linear regression. Read the lab instructions carefully.\n\n-   There are markers throughout suggesting when to render, commit, and push changes to GitHub. These are to help you start using version control in your workflow.\n\n-   There are points for having a neatly formatted document and implementing a reproducible workflow. See the Workflow & Formatting section in the Lab 01 instructions.\n\nðŸ”— [sta210-fa23.netlify.app/labs/lab-01.html](https://sta210-fa23.netlify.app/labs/lab-01.html)\n",
