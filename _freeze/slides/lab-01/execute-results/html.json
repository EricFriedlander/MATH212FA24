One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.\n\n-   Do not pressure each other to finish early (particularly once you start working on teams); use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.\n\n## **When you're done with lab**\n\n-   Make sure all your final changes have been pushed to your GitHub repo\n\n-   Submit the PDF of your responses to [**Gradescope**](https://www.gradescope.com/)\n\n    -   You can access Gradescope through Sakai or the course website\n\n    -   Login using your Duke NetID credentials\n\n    -   See Lab 01 instructions for details on submitting an assignment on Gradescope\n\n\\\n",
