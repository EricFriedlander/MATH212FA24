This AE does not count towards the Application Exercise grade.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggformula)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nOur dataset contains daily rentals from the Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC in 2011 and 2012. It was obtained from the `dcbikeshare` data set in the `dsbox` R package.\n\nWe will focus on the following variables in the analysis:\n\n-   `count`: total bike rentals\n-   `temp_orig`: Temperature in degrees Celsius\n-   `season`: 1 - winter, 2 - spring, 3 - summer, 4 - fall\n\nClick [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/dcbikeshare.html) for the full list of variables and definitions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbikeshare <- read_csv(\"data/dcbikeshare.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Daily counts and temperature\n\nLet first visualize the distribution of daily bike rentals and temperature as well as the relationship between these two variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 <- gf_histogram(~count, data = bikeshare, binwidth = 250) |>  \n  gf_labs(x = \"Daily bike rentals\")\n\np2 <- gf_histogram(~temp_orig, data = bikeshare) |> \n  gf_labs(x = \"Temperature (Celsius)\")\n\np3 <- gf_point(count ~ temp_orig, data = bikeshare)  |>  \n  gf_labs(x = \"Temperature (Celsius)\", \n       y = \"Daily bike rentals\")\n\n(p1 | p2) / p3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bikeshare_files/figure-html/bike-temp-viz-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSubmit your answers to the following questions to [Poll Everywhere](https://PollEv.com/surveys/2s7kJw1CFyYM3oNOMi3uF/respond).\n\n### Exercise 1\n\nDescribe the relationship between daily bike rentals and temperature. Comment on how we expect the number of bike rentals to change as the temperature increases.\n\n### Exercise 2\n\nSuppose you want to fit a model so you can use the temperature to predict the number of bike rentals. Would a model of the form\n\n$$\\text{count} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 ~ \\text{temp\\_orig} + \\epsilon$$\n\nbe an appropriate fit for the data? Why or why not?\n\n",
