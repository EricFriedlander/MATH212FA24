It is a simulated data set of 400 credit card customers. We will focus on the following variables:\n\n**Predictors**\n\n-   `Income`: Annual income (in 1000's of US dollars)\n-   `Rating`: Credit Rating\n\n**Response**\n\n-   `Limit`: Credit limit\n\n## Analysis goal\n\nThe goals of this activity are to:\n\n-   Perform inference for multiple linear regression\n-   Conduct/interpret hypothesis tests\n-   Construct/interpret confidence intervals\n\n## Exercise 0\n\nFit and display two linear regression models predicting `Limit` from `Income` and `Rating`. In one, include an interaction term between the two variables and in the other, do not.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nConsider the model *without* an interaction term. Perform a hypothesis test on `Rating` (fill in the blanks where appropriate:\n\n1.  **Set hypothesis:** $H_0: \\beta_{Rating} [fill in]$ vs. $\\beta_{Rating} [fill in]$. Restate these hypothesis in words: \\[fill in\\]\n2.  **Calculate test statistics and p-value:** The test statistic is $[fill in]$. The p-value is $[fill in]$.\n3.  **State the conclusion:** \\[fill in\\]\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nConsider the model *with* an interaction term. Interpret the p-value associated with `Income` and the p-value associated with the interaction term.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nGenerate 95% confidence intervals for the model *without* an interaction term. Hint: use the `tidy` function with the argument `conf.int = TRUE`. Interpret the confidence interval for `Income` and explain why the combination of p-value and confidence interval makes sense.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nWhat does it mean for two things to be **independent** in statistics (feel free to use google)? Do we think our p-values/confidence intervals are **independent** across variables?\n\n## To submit the AE\n\n::: callout-important\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Upload your QMD and PDF files to the Canvas assignment.\n:::\n",
