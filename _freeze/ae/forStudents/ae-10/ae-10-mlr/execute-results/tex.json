The `.qmd` and PDF responses are due in Canvas. You can check the due date on the Canvas assignment.\n:::\n\n## Packages + data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggformula)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ISLR2)\nlibrary(GGally)\nlibrary(yardstick)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data for this AE is from the `Credit` data set in the **ISLR2** R package. It is a simulated data set of 400 credit card customers. We will focus on the following variables:\n\n**Predictors**\n\n-   `Income`: Annual income (in 1000's of US dollars)\n-   `Rating`: Credit Rating\n\n**Response**\n\n-   `Limit`: Credit limit\n\n## Analysis goal\n\nThe goals of this analysis are to fit a linear regression model that has the following predictors:\n\n-   `Income`\n-   `Rating`\n-   An interaction term between the two\n\n## Exercise 0\n\nWhat is a credit rating and what is a credit limit as it applies to a credit card? The primary credit rating in the US is called a FICO score. Based on the data, do you think that `Rating` corresponds to the borrower's FICO score?\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nUse the function `ggpairs` from the `GGally` package (already loaded) to create a matrix of plots and correlations for our three variables of interest. Note that you will have to use `select` to select the four columns you are interested in. Which variable do you think will be the best predictor of `Limit`?\n\n## Exercise 1B (Optional)\n\nIf you have extra time, examine the variables individually and comment on anything that you think is relevant.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nFit a linear model with just `Income` as the predictor and get the p-value associated with it's coefficient. Is it statistically significant?\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nFit a linear model with just `Rating` as the predictor and get the p-value associated with it's coefficient. Is it statistically significant?\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nFit a model with both `Income` and `Rating` as predictors. Find a spot on the white board to write down an equation representing the fitted model. How do the coefficients and p-values of `Income` and `Rating` compare to those in the two models above? Discuss what you see and the possible reasons you see them.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nInterpret all coefficients in the model.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nWhat is the predicted credit limit for an *single* borrower with a credit rating of 700 and an annual income of \\$59,000? Include a 90% confidence interval. Hint: make a new `tibble` and use the `predict` function. How would you interpret this interval in context?\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nAdd an interaction term between `Rating` and `Income`. Interpret all coefficients in context. What do you notice about the p-values now?\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nWhat is the predicted credit limit for an single borrower with a credit rating of 700 and an annual income of \\$59,000? Include a 90% confidence interval. How does it compare to your answer to Exercise 6.\n\n## Exercise 9 (Optional)\n\nNote that this data set only considers borrowers who have actually been granted loans. How does this impact the generalizability of our analysis?\n\n## To submit the AE\n\n::: callout-important\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Upload your QMD and PDF files to the Canvas assignment.\n:::\n",
