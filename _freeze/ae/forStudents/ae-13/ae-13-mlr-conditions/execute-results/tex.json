The `.qmd` and PDF responses are due in Canvas. You can check the due date on the Canvas assignment.\n:::\n\n## Packages + data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggformula)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(mosaic)\nlibrary(mosaicData)\n\nrail_trail <- read_csv(\"rail_trail.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data for this AE is based on data from the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) and is included in the **mosaicData** package. The PVPC collected data for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to November 15, 2005. Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station. More information can be found [here](http://www.fvgreenway.org/pdfs/Northampton-Bikepath-Volume-Counts%20_05_LTA.pdf).\n\n## Analysis goal\n\nThe goals of this activity are to:\n\n-   Determine whether the conditions for inference are satisfied in this multi-predictor setting.\n\n## Exercise 0\n\nFit a linear model to predict `volume` from ALL of the other predictors. The resulting model is called the \"full model\". Hint: if you use the formula `volume ~ .` in your `lm` command, it will automatically include all predictors. Once you have fit your model, use `tidy` to print it out. Have the reporter for you group write down the model on the white board. Does the model include any interaction terms?\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nAugment the model you created above using the `augment` function. Generate a scatter plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values for this model.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nMake two plots:\n\n1.  Residuals vs. `precip`.\n2.  Residuals vs. `day_type`.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nBased on the three plots you've made and the four on the screen, do you think the linearity condition is satisfied?\n\n## Exerise 4\n\nWe check the constant variance assumption in the same way we do with SLR. Does the constant variance condition seems to be satisfied?\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nGenerate a histogram of the residuals. If you have time, [also generate a QQ-plot of the residuals](https://mat212fa24.netlify.app/slides/10-slr-conditions#/check-normality-using-a-qq-plot). Do you believe the normality condition is satisfied?\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nHow do you think would you go about checking the independence condition?\n\n## To submit the AE\n\n::: callout-important\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Upload your QMD and PDF files to the Canvas assignment.\n:::\n",
