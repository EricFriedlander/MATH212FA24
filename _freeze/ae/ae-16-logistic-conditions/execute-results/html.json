It contains information for U.S. adults (age 18+) who participated in the 2009 - 2010 and 2011 - 2012 years of the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) (NHANES). You can find details about how participants are selected on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/participant/participant-selected.htm).\\\n\\\nWe will consider the following variables:\n\n-   `HealthGen`: Self-reported rating of participant's health in general. Excellent, Vgood, Good, Fair, or Poor.\n\n-   `Age`: Age at time of screening (in years). Participants 80 or older were recorded as 80.\n\n-   `PhysActive`: Participant does moderate to vigorous-intensity sports, fitness or recreational activities.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnhanes_adult <- read_csv(\"data/nhanes-adult.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will check the model conditions for a model that uses age and physical activity to understand the odds an adult in the United States rates their health as \"excellent\".\n\n1.  Create a new variable called `HealthExcellent` that takes values 1 if `HealthGen` = Excellent and 0 otherwise. Make a table showing the distribution of `HealthExcellent`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  Calculate the empirical logit of `HealthExcellent` for each level of `PhysActive`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code\n```\n:::\n\n\n3.  Check the model conditions for logistic regression. State whether each condition is satisfied and briefly explain your response.\n    -   Linearity\n\n    -   Randomness\n\n    -   Independence\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-important\nTo submit the AE:\n\n-   Render the document to produce the PDF with all of your work from today's class.\n-   Push all your work to your `ae-15`6repo on GitHub. (You do not submit AEs on Gradescope).\n:::\n",
