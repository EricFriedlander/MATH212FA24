The data were originally obtained from Spotify using the **spotifyr** R package.\n\nIt contains numerous characteristics for each song. You can see the full list of variables and definitions [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md).

Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. |\n| valence          | double    | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).                                                                                                                                         |\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspotify <- read_csv(\"data/spotify-popular.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAre high energy songs more positive? To answer this question, we'll analyze data on some of the most popular songs on Spotify, i.e. those with `track_popularity >= 80`. We'll use linear regression to fit a model to predict a song's positiveness (`valence`) based on its energy level (`energy`).\n\nBelow are plots as part of the exploratory data analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 <- gf_histogram(~valence, data = spotify) |>  \n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Valence\", \n       subtitle = \" for Popular songs on Spotify\", \n       x = \"Valence\")\n\np2 <- gf_histogram(~energy, data = spotify) |> \n  gf_labs(title = \"Distribution of Energy\", \n       subtitle = \"for Popular songs on Spotify\", \n       x = \"Energy\")\np1 + p2 # The patchwork package will arrange your plots for you\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-05-math-models_files/figure-html/univariate-eda-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_point(valence ~ energy, data = spotify) |> \n  gf_labs(title = \"Valence vs. Energy\", \n       subtitle = \"Popular songs on Spotify\", \n       x = \"Energy\", \n       y = \"Valence\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-05-math-models_files/figure-html/bivariate-eda-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nFit a model using the `energy` of a song to predict its `valence`, i.e. positiveness.
