You will have the opportunity to ask and answer 3 different research questions: one using only one variable, and two exploring the relationship between two variables. Although not required, **you may re-use your work from Station 2.**\n\nPlease reference the data codebook (available on the Data sets tab on Canvas) to decide which variables you'd like to use when forming your research question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Univariate: Quantitative\n--------------------\n\n**TASK 1.1.1--Choose a quantitative variable from the US States dataset you'd like to explore.  What is the variable?  **\n\n\n\n### Pose a research question\n \n\n**TASK 1.1.2--What would be a reasonable research question to ask about this parameter?**  Your answer should make sense practically.\n\n\n\n**TASK 1.1.3--Write the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the population parameter.**  If your research question is better suited for a confidence interval, you do not need to state hypotheses.  \n\n\n\n\n### Perform EDA\n\nA good EDA should attempt to preliminarily answer the research question and also identify any issues that might impact eventual inference.  \n\n**TASK 1.1.4--Generate a relevant plot for your research question. **\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n**TASK 1.1.5-- Calculate the summary statistic that is most relevant to your CI/test.**  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n**TASK 1.1.6--Write a few sentences summarizing what you learned from your EDA**\n\n\n### Answer the question using inference\n\nTo answer your research question, you'll need to test the hypotheses you defined earlier, or construct the relevant confidence interval.\n\n**TASK 1.1.7--What is the name of the statistical test or interval you will perform/construct  (e.g., 1-sample t-test for the mean, CI for the difference in means, 1-sample proportion test)?**\n\n\n\n**TASK 1.1.8--Did your EDA indicate any problems with performing this test/CI? That is, are the conditions for inference met?**\n\n\n\n**TASK 1.1.9--Use R to generate the test statistic and p-value, or build the confidence interval.**  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n**TASK 1.1.10--Make a conclusion about the null and alternative hypotheses, being sure to answer your research question in context. OR Provide an interpretation of the confidence interval in context.**  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Relationship between two variables 1: Numerical/Binary\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nChoose two variables from the Codebook: one numerical, one binary. In this section you will investigate the relationship between these two variables. \n\n**TASK 2.1.1--What are the two variables?**  Your answer should include a brief description and be more than simply the variable name.\n\n\n\n### Pose a research question\n\n**TASK 2.1.2--What would be a reasonable research question to ask about this parameter?**  Your answer should make sense practically.\n\n\n\n\n**TASK 2.1.3--Write the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the population parameter.** In this case, I want you to perform a hypothesis test. Later, I'll also have you build the CI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Perform EDA\n\nRemember, a good EDA should attempt to answer the research questions and also identify any issues that might impact eventual inference.  \n\n**TASK 2.1.4--Generate a relevant plot for your research question.**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n**TASK 2.1.5--Calculate the summary statistics that are most relevant to your test.**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n**TASK 2.1.6--Write a few sentences summarizing what you learned from your EDA**\n\n\n\n\n### Answer the question using inference\n\nTo answer your research question, you'll need to test the hypotheses you defined earlier.  \n\n**TASK 2.1.7--What is the name of the statistical test you will perform?**\n\n\n**TASK 2.1.8--Did your EDA indicate any problems with performing this test?

Relationship between two variables 2: Binary/Binary\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nChoose two binary variables from the Codebook. In this section you will investigate the relationship between these two variables. \n\n**TASK 2.2.1--What are the two variables?**  Your answer should include a brief description and be more than simply the variable name.\n\n\n\n### Pose a research question\n\n**TASK 2.2.2--What would be a reasonable research question to ask about this parameter?**  Your answer should make sense practically.\n\n\n\n\n**TASK 2.2.3--Write the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the population parameter.** In this case, I want you to perform a hypothesis test.
