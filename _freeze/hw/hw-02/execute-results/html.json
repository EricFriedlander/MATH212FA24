See [Lab 01](../labs/lab-01.qmd) for more detailed instructions on getting started.\n\n# Packages\n\nThe following packages will be used in this assignment:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels) \nlibrary(knitr) \nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\nAll narrative should be written in complete sentences, and all visualizations should have informative titles and axis labels.\n:::\n\n# Data: Palmer Penguins\n\nData were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). [@gorman2014]\n\n\\\nThese data can be found in the **palmerpenguins** package. We're going to be working with the `penguins` dataset from this package. The dataset contains data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. [Click here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) to see the codebook.\n\n# Exercises\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nOur eventual goal is to fit a model predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, species, and sex.\n\nWe will start by preparing the data.\n\n-   Use the `drop_na()` function to remove any observations from the `penguins` data frame that has missing values. Your resulting data frame should have 333 observations.\n\n::: callout-note\nFor the purposes of this assignment, we will treat the missingness as random, i.e., this is still a representative sample even though we removed observations with missing values.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2\n\n-   Use the data to fit a model predicting body mass (which can be difficult to measure) from bill length. Fit the model in a way such that the intercept has a meaningful interpretation.\n\n-   Neatly display the model using 3 digits.\n\n-   Write the estimated regression equation. Use the variable names in your equation.\n\n-   Interpret the slope in the context of the data.\n\n-   Calculate the $R^2$ value.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\n-   Plot the fitted values vs. the residual values for the model in the previous exercise.\n\n-   Make another plot of the histogram of the residuals.\n\n-   Is a linear regression appropriate? Why or why not?\n\n## Exercise 4\n\n-   The p-value in Exercise 2 indicates statistical significance. Does this mean the model is a good fit for the data?\n\n## Exercise 5\n\n-   Now, use the data to fit a model predicting body mass (which can be difficult to measure) from bill length, bill depth, flipper length, island, species, and sex. Only include main effects, i.e., no interaction terms, in this model.\n\n-   Neatly display the model using 3 digits.\n\n-   Write the estimated regression equation. Use the variable names in your equation.\n\n-   Calculate the $R^2$ value. Why is it larger than the previous one? Interpret this value in context of the data and the model.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe code for fitting multiple linear regression models is the same as simple linear regression. Use `+` to add multiple predictor variables to the model.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 6\n\n-   Plot the fitted values vs. the residual values for the model in the previous exercise.\n\n-   Make another plot of the histogram of the residuals.\n\n-   Is a linear regression appropriate? Why or why not?\n\n## Exercise 7\n\n-   Interpret the intercept in the context of the data.\n\n-   Interpret the coefficient of sex in the context of the data.\n\n-   Interpret coefficient (slope) of bill length in the context of the data.\n\n-   Is the coefficient of bill length the same as in Exercise 2. Briefly explain why or why not?\n\n## Exercise 8\n\n-   Calculate the residual for a female Gentoo penguin on the Biscoe island that weighs 4450 grams with the following body measurements: `bill_length_mm` = 43.2, `bill_depth_mm` = 14.5, `flipper_length_mm` = 208.\n\n-   Does the model overpredict or underpredict this penguin's mass?\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nFill in the starter code below to write the function `predict_boots` which takes a bootstrap sample, calculates $R^2$ terms for the two models listed below. Set the seed to `29`.\n\n-   **Model 1**: The model from Exercise 5. **Model 2**: The model from Exercise 5, *without* the island term.\n\n-   The last line of the code runs the function `predict_boots` for 1000 iterations and saves the output as the object `r_squared_diffs`. Create a new variable that calculates the difference between the $R^2$ values for the two models.\n\n-   Make a histogram of the differences.\n\n-   What do you notice about the histogram?\n\n-   Which model is best for predicting body mass of a penguin?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(29)\n\npredict_boots <- function(i) {\n  # take a bootstrap sample\n  boot <- penguins |>\n    slice_sample(n = nrow(penguins), replace = TRUE) |>\n    mutate(boot_samp = i)\n  \n  #fit the model with island to the bootstrap sample\n  fit_island <- linear_reg() |>\n    fit(_____, data = boot)\n  \n  # fit the model without island to the bootstrap sample\n  fit_no_island <- linear_reg() |>\n    fit(_______, data = boot)\n  \n  #save the rsq values for each model\n  tibble(\n    island_r2 = glance(fit_island)$r.squared,\n    no_island_r2 = glance(fit_no_island)$r.squared\n  )\n}\n\n# run the function 1000 times and save the differences between\nr_squared_diffs <- map_df(1:1000, predict_boots)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 10\n\n-   Use the model from the previous exercise without island, and set the seed to `210`.\n\n-   Fit the model to 1000 bootstrap samples.\n\n-   Make a scatterplot of the estimated coefficients for flipper length (y-axis) vs. bill length (x-axis).\n\n-   Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between these coefficient values. Is there evidence that either bill length or flipper length has a larger influence on the model? Briefly explain.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe code for bootstrapping in multiple linear regression is the same as the code for simple linear regression.\n:::\n\n# Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.
