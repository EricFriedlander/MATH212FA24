To collect data, Hickey and collaborators at FiveThirtyEight set up an experiment people could vote on a series of randomly generated candy matchups (e.g. Reeses vs. Skittles). Click [here](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/) to check out some of the match ups.\n\nThe data set contains the characteristics and win percentage from 85 candies in the experiment. The variables are\n\n| Variable           | Description                                                               |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `chocolate`        | Does it contain chocolate?                                                |\n| `fruity`           | Is it fruit flavored?                                                     |\n| `caramel`          | Is there caramel in the candy?                                            |\n| `peanutalmondy`    | Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?                        |\n| `nougat`           | Does it contain nougat?                                                   |\n| `crispedricewafer` | Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component?              |\n| `hard`             | Is it a hard candy?                                                       |\n| `bar`              | Is it a candy bar?                                                        |\n| `pluribus`         | Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?                                |\n| `sugarpercent`     | The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set.

Change the scale so that they are percentages.\n\n## Exercise 2\n\n-   Our response variable in this homework will be `winpercentage`. Choose two additional variables, one quantitative and one categorical. Generate a SINGLE plot that visualizes all three variables. Hint: remember that you can tie any aesthetic in your plot (e.g. color) to a variable be writing `aesthatic = ~variable_name`.\n-   Write two observations from your plot.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nFit a linear model including both variables you chose above and include an interaction term between the two.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nInterpret the following in the context of the data:\n\n-   Intercept\n\n-   Coefficient of your quantitative variable\n\n-   Coefficient(s) of your categorical variables\n\n-   Coefficient(s) of your interaction term.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nChoose one of the coefficients from your model and write out all the steps in the hypothesis test that corresponds to it's p-value as in [this slide](https://mat212fa24.netlify.app/slides/16-mlr-inference#/mlr-hypothesis-test-income).\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nInterpret the other p-values in your model in the context of the data. You do not need to write out the full hypothesis testing framework as you did in Exercise 5.\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nGenerate 95% confidence intervals for all of the slopes in your model and interpret them in the context of the data. Are these intervals independent of one another?\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nFit a linear model predicting `winpercent` using `chocolate` and `pricepercent` as predictors. Include a interaction term between `pricepercent` and `chocolate`. Describe the effect of `pricepercent` for chocolate candy in the context of the data.\n\n## Exercise 9\n\n-   Consider the model from Exercise 3 \"Model 1\" and the model fit in Exercise 8 \"Model 2\". If you happened to have chosen `pricepercent` and `chocolate` in Exercise 3, please choose two new variables and to complete this problem with.\n\n-   Which model would you choose based on $R^2$? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n-   Which model would you choose based on $RMSE$? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n## Exercise 10\n\n-   Use the model you selected in Exercise 9 to describe what generally makes a good candy, i.e., one with a high win percentage.\n\n## Grading\n\nTotal points available: 50 points.\n\n| Component             | Points |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Ex 1                  | 2      |\n| Ex 2                  | 3      |\n| Ex 3                  | 5      |\n| Ex 4                  | 8      |\n| Ex 5                  | 6      |\n| Ex 6                  | 5      |\n| Ex 7                  | 5      |\n| Ex 8                  | 4      |\n| Ex 9                  | 4      |\n| Ex 10                 | 4      |\n| Workflow & formatting | 4[^1]  |\n\n[^1]: The \"Workflow & formatting\" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow, clarity, and professionalism.\n",
