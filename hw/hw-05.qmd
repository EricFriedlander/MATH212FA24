## Introduction

In today's lab you will analyze data about candy that was collected from an online experiment conducted at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/).

### Learning goals

By the end of the lab you will be able to

-   describe the components of a recipe
-   fit a model using recipes
-   compare models
-   continue developing a collaborative workflow with your teammates

## Getting started

-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.
-   Go to the [sta210-fa23](https://github.com/sta210-fa23) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-05**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.
-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.
-   **Do not make any changes to the `.qmd` file until the instructions tell you do to so.**

## Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team

::: callout-important
There are no Team Member markers in this lab; however, you should use a similar workflow as in Lab 04. Only one person should type in the group's .qmd file at a time. Once that person has finished typing the group's responses, they should *render, commit, and push* the changes to GitHub. All other teammates can *pull* to see the updates in RStudio.

Every teammate must have at least one commit in the lab. Everyone is expected to contribute to discussion even when they are not typing.

## Packages

The following packages are used in the lab.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
#| eval: true

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(knitr)

# add other packages as needed
```

## Data: Candy

The data from this lab comes from the the article FiveThirtyEight [*The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking) by Walt Hickey. To collect data, Hickey and collaborators at FiveThirtyEight set up an experiment people could vote on a series of randomly generated candy matchups (e.g. Reeses vs. Skittles). Click [here](http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/) to check out some of the match ups.

The data set contains the characteristics and win percentage from 85 candies in the experiment. The variables are

| Variable           | Description                                                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chocolate`        | Does it contain chocolate?                                                |
| `fruity`           | Is it fruit flavored?                                                     |
| `caramel`          | Is there caramel in the candy?                                            |
| `peanutalmondy`    | Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?                        |
| `nougat`           | Does it contain nougat?                                                   |
| `crispedricewafer` | Does it contain crisped rice, wafers, or a cookie component?              |
| `hard`             | Is it a hard candy?                                                       |
| `bar`              | Is it a candy bar?                                                        |
| `pluribus`         | Is it one of many candies in a bag or box?                                |
| `sugarpercent`     | The percentile of sugar it falls under within the data set. Values 0 - 1. |
| `pricepercent`     | The unit price percentile compared to the rest of the set. Values 0 - 1.  |
| `winpercent`       | The overall win percentage according to 269,000 matchups. Values 0 - 100. |

Use the code below to get a glimpse of the `candy_rankings` data frame in the **fivethirtyeight** R package.

```{r eval = T}
glimpse(candy_rankings)
```

## Exercises

The goal of this analysis is to use multiple linear regression to understand the factors that make a good candy.

### Exercise 1

-   Use `ggplot` to make a graph of your choice exploring the relationship between at least 3 variables in the data set.

-   Write two observations from your graph.

### Exercise 2

Split the data into training (80%) and testing sets (20%). Call the training set `candy_train` and the testing set `candy_test`. Use a seed of `2`.

### Exercise 3

Below is a recipe for a model that uses the characteristics of candy to understand variability in the win percentage. The lines of the `recipe` code are labeled *Line 1* - *Line 9.* Describe what each line of code does. The explanation should be written comprehensively and specifically enough that someone could replicate the data manipulation steps based on your description.

For example, if a line of code is `step_center(X)`, a comprehensive and specific explanation something similar to the following: "This line of code mean centers the variable $X$ by subtracting $\bar{X}$ from each value of $X$ in the training data."

::: callout-tip
Use the [Recipes Function Reference](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html) page as a resource to learn more about the `step_` functions.
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false

#Line 1
candy_rec <- recipe(winpercent ~ ., data = candy_train) |> 
#Line 2
  update_role(competitorname, new_role = "ID") |> 
# Line 3
  step_cut(sugarpercent, breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)) |> 
#Line 4
  step_mutate(pricepercent = pricepercent * 100) |> 
#Line 5
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) |> 
#Line 6
  step_interact(terms =~ pricepercent:chocolate) |> 
#Line 7
  step_interact(terms =~ peanutyalmondy:chocolate) |> 
#Line 8
  step_rm(fruity, caramel, hard, pluribus, bar, nougat, crispedricewafer) |> 
#Line 9
  step_zv(all_predictors()) 
```

### Exercise 4

Fill in the code to use `prep` and `bake` for a preview of what will happen when the recipe in Exercise 3 is applied.

```{r}
candy_rec |>
  prep() |>
  bake(_____) |>
  glimpse()
```

How many terms (not including the intercept) will be in the model produced by this recipe?

### Exercise 5

Fill in the code to specify model, build the model workflow using the recipe in Exercise 2, and fit the model to the training data. Then, neatly display the model using 3 digits.

```{r}
#specify the model
candy_spec <- linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm")

#build model workflow
candy_workflow <- workflow() |>
  add_model(_____) |>
  add_recipe(_____) 

# fit the model 
candy_fit <- candy_workflow |>
  fit(data = _____)
```

### Exercise 6

Interpret the following in the context of the data:

-   Intercept

-   Coefficient of `sugarpercent_X.0.75.1.`

-   Coefficient of `pricepercent_x_chocolateTRUE`

-   Effect of `pricepercent` for chocolate candy

### Exercise 7

Let's consider another model. Use the `recipe` workflow to fit a new model that meets the following criteria:

-   Includes variables `chocolate`, `pricepercent`, `crispedricewafer`, `peanutyalmondy`, `sugarpercent`

-   Update `pricepercent` so it ranges from 0 to 100 (instead of 0 to 1)

-   Makes `sugarpercent` a factor where the levels equal the four quartiles: 0 - 0.25, 0.25 - 0.50, 0.50 - 0.75, 0.75 - 1

-   Includes the interaction between `pricepercent` and `peanutyalmondy`

Neatly display the model using 3 digits.

See the [Function Reference](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html) page on [recipes.tidymodels.org](https://recipes.tidymodels.org) to find the appropriate recipe functions.
:::

### Exercise 8

-   Consider the model from Exercise 5 "Model 1" and the model fit in Exercise 7 "Model 2". Use the `glance()` function to calculate $R^2$ for both of these models.

-   Which model would you choose based on $R^2$? Briefly explain your choice.

### Exercise 9

We will use RMSE to evalulate the predictive performance of each model on the testing data.

-   Use the code below to calculate predicted values and RMSE for Model 1 on the testing data. Then get the RMSE for Model 2 on the testing data.

```{r}
predict_test1 <- predict(candy_fit, candy_test) |> 
  bind_cols(candy_test)

rmse1 <- rmse(predict_test1, truth = winpercent, estimate = .pred)
```

-   Which model would you choose based on RMSE on the testing data? Briefly explain your choice.

### Exercise 10

-   Use the model you selected in Exercise 9 to describe what generally makes a good candy, i.e., one with a high win percentage.
