## Introduction

You should remember the basics of hypothesis testing from your introductory statistics class, whether it was MAT 125, AP statistics, or a course through a different school or department.  **You can find the R code to perform all the necessary inference procedures on the "Inference Summary Sheet" page under the Computing tab on the course website.**

At this station, you will pose and answer research questions from beginning to end, using the US States data (from Station 2).  You will have the opportunity to ask and answer 3 different research questions: one using only one variable, and two exploring the relationship between two variables. Although not required, **you may re-use your work from Station 2.**

Please reference the data codebook (available on the Data sets tab on Canvas) to decide which variables you'd like to use when forming your research question. 

```{r, include = F}
#load the US_States data set here. Remember that even if it's already loaded in your "Environment"/Console, you'll still need to load it into the RMarkdown document here!

```


A. Univariate: Quantitative
--------------------

**TASK 1.1.1--Choose a quantitative variable from the US States dataset you'd like to explore.  What is the variable?  **



### Pose a research question
 

**TASK 1.1.2--What would be a reasonable research question to ask about this parameter?**  Your answer should make sense practically.



**TASK 1.1.3--Write the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the population parameter.**  If your research question is better suited for a confidence interval, you do not need to state hypotheses.  




### Perform EDA

A good EDA should attempt to preliminarily answer the research question and also identify any issues that might impact eventual inference.  

**TASK 1.1.4--Generate a relevant plot for your research question. **
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

```

**TASK 1.1.5-- Calculate the summary statistic that is most relevant to your CI/test.**  

```{r}

```


**TASK 1.1.6--Write a few sentences summarizing what you learned from your EDA**


### Answer the question using inference

To answer your research question, you'll need to test the hypotheses you defined earlier, or construct the relevant confidence interval.

**TASK 1.1.7--What is the name of the statistical test or interval you will perform/construct  (e.g., 1-sample t-test for the mean, CI for the difference in means, 1-sample proportion test)?**



**TASK 1.1.8--Did your EDA indicate any problems with performing this test/CI? That is, are the conditions for inference met?**



**TASK 1.1.9--Use R to generate the test statistic and p-value, or build the confidence interval.**  
```{r}

```


**TASK 1.1.10--Make a conclusion about the null and alternative hypotheses, being sure to answer your research question in context. OR Provide an interpretation of the confidence interval in context.**  






B. Relationship between two variables 1: Numerical/Binary
--------------------------------------------------------

Choose two variables from the Codebook: one numerical, one binary. In this section you will investigate the relationship between these two variables. 

**TASK 2.1.1--What are the two variables?**  Your answer should include a brief description and be more than simply the variable name.



### Pose a research question

**TASK 2.1.2--What would be a reasonable research question to ask about this parameter?**  Your answer should make sense practically.




**TASK 2.1.3--Write the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the population parameter.** In this case, I want you to perform a hypothesis test. Later, I'll also have you build the CI.






### Perform EDA

Remember, a good EDA should attempt to answer the research questions and also identify any issues that might impact eventual inference.  

**TASK 2.1.4--Generate a relevant plot for your research question.**
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

```


**TASK 2.1.5--Calculate the summary statistics that are most relevant to your test.**
```{r}

```


**TASK 2.1.6--Write a few sentences summarizing what you learned from your EDA**




### Answer the question using inference

To answer your research question, you'll need to test the hypotheses you defined earlier.  

**TASK 2.1.7--What is the name of the statistical test you will perform?**


**TASK 2.1.8--Did your EDA indicate any problems with performing this test? That is, are the conditions for inference met?**



**TASK 2.1.9--Use R to generate the test statistic and p-value.**  
```{r}

```


**TASK 2.1.10--Make a conclusion about the null and alternative hypotheses, being sure to answer your research question in context.**  




**TASK 2.1.11--Now use R to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the parameter of interest, and provide an interpretation in context.** First, you must ask yourself, "What *is* the parameter of interest?"
```{r}

```


C. Relationship between two variables 2: Binary/Binary
--------------------------------------------------------

Choose two binary variables from the Codebook. In this section you will investigate the relationship between these two variables. 

**TASK 2.2.1--What are the two variables?**  Your answer should include a brief description and be more than simply the variable name.



### Pose a research question

**TASK 2.2.2--What would be a reasonable research question to ask about this parameter?**  Your answer should make sense practically.




**TASK 2.2.3--Write the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the population parameter.** In this case, I want you to perform a hypothesis test. Later, I'll also have you build the CI.







### Perform EDA

Remember, a good EDA should attempt to answer the research questions and also identify any issues that might impact eventual inference.  

**TASK 2.2.4--Generate a relevant plot for your research question.**
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

```


**TASK 2.2.5--Calculate the summary statistics that are most relevant to your hypothesis test.**
```{r}

```


**TASK 2.2.6--Write a few sentences summarizing what you learned from your EDA**




### Answer the question using inference

To answer your research question, you'll need to test the hypotheses you defined earlier.  

**TASK 2.2.7--What is the name of the statistical test will you perform to test the hypotheses?**


**TASK 2.2.8--Did your EDA indicate any problems with performing this test? That is, are the conditions for inference met?**



**TASK 2.2.9--Use R to generate the test statistic and p-value.**  
```{r}

```


**TASK 2.2.10--Make a conclusion about the null and alternative hypotheses, being sure to answer your research question in context.**  




**TASK 2.2.11--Now use R to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the parameter of interest, and provide an interpretation in context.** First, you must ask yourself, "What *is* the parameter of interest?"
```{r}
